<p>I have been playing around with Urho3D for quite sometime now and I think its just amazing, I would like to thanks the team, the engine is just awesome.</p>
<p>I would like to know if there is a way to change an object’s rotation pivot. In 3d max I didnt center the object, but i want in Urho to be able to rotate on the object’s center. I tried in 3d max to change the pivot and it works in the program but after exporting, the pivot resets to the center. I tried in Urho with SetGeometry Center but that didnt seems to work, also tried to translate the object back to origin, rotate and the translate it back to the position.</p>

<p>You can add a node to your object, and put offset to the node. Then you can rotate the node, which would work as a new “center”  point.</p>

<p>Thx thats a good idea, but if i have many objects which are going to be childs of empty nodes, wouldnt that be a burden? or affect performance if I have many objects?</p>

<p>Your’s models may do this offset by it vertexes position in geometry.<br/>
In blender you just reset pos transformation (bring model to world’s origin), then enter to edit mode and do this offset as you wish.<br/>
Then you just export this model with offset and use in engine. this is most cheapest way I guess )</p>

<p>Not really. Nodes are very cheap, and primarily just store the transform which is what you would be doing in any other solution without baking the center into your assets.</p>

<p>codingmonkey: but then I will not be able to change it at runtime or at the end I will have to use the empty node, which now that i know nodes are not a burden (thanks bluesfish) i will use them, is a better solution for what  i am trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
