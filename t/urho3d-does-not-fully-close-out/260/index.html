<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I downloaded the latest tar file and compiled it. It compiled 100% and installed. A manner .Urho3D directory update and now the editor loads correctly.</p>
<p>The version I downloaded was urho3d-Urho3D-c4b337d</p>
<p>The problem I have with is closing. You can see it in the videos I’m making.  If I run the <a href="http://editor.sh" rel="nofollow noopener">editor.sh</a> program from the command line Urho3D does not fully exit out. I have to type ctrl-c to exit back to the command line. Is anyone having the same problem? You will see the problem at the end of the video.</p>

<p>Looks like you are using a terminal emulator.  Try using the terminal that ships with the os.  That is just my guess.</p>

<p>In my opinion this should not be caused by the terminal emulator. I use one myself and I don’t have this closing issue. Urho applications can be launched from an interactive shell in any type of terminal or even from a debugger within any IDE, the app would not know the difference.</p>
<p>There could be a bug in the Editor. When closing, it attempts to re-create the configuration directory before saving the editor configuration settings. Under normal circumstances, this approach works for initial run as well as subsequent runs. However, I suspect the function responsible for creating the directory trips over in your case. I notice your homedir is now mounted from a different filesystem. I believe that could be the reason why it fails.</p>

<p>I tried chmod 755 and change ownership vivienne:viveienne in the .Urho3D directory includingrecurvsive folders. The home folder is in the same mounted filesystem as /usr/local/share/Urho3D. I tried Xterm and also Konsole with the same response. I also viewed the .log to see if any exiting logs is done.</p>
<p>Still the same problem. I’m assuming the exit code is tripping over itself like you mentioned.  I’m assuming if it is trying to recreate both the folder and file again. It’s getting stuck specifically on Ubuntu instead of checking if the folder and file already exist. I have not seen the code but that’s my only guess.</p>

<p>Cool!</p>
<p>Point A - Tried. Still same problem using Xterm and Konsole</p>
<p>Point B - Got that.</p>
<p>Point C - Cool. If I have any ideas of the Editor UI. I’ll mention it. The only thing I can think of is making the windows and menu bar a different color background instead of black with some opacity to it.  Still the search or highlight by keyword would be a nice Editor update in the hierarchy list.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Since you did not answer the second question, I assume the answer is the same as the first. In which case, it is a dead end for me. I am still curios though, why your shell prompt sometimes show you are in /home and on the other times you are in /media/home2? That’s what mislead me as if you are dealing with two filesystems here. Or you have actually two user accounts which go to these two places? Anyway, I have tried to help. May be others could help to continue from here.</p>
<p>As a last resort, perhaps you could try to delete the .Urho3D directory and let it to be recreated again. It’s a long but desperate shot  <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/c16ddadcbd525aa6d219a1df596d362f.png" title=":smiley:"/> .</p>

<p>The home folder is the default folde /home/vivienne.</p>
<p>I have a separate drive with a home partition whish is /media/home2/viviennee. It’s just the name of it. The actual home is /home/vivienne where the .Urho3D is created.</p>
<p>I have tons of data and programs on /media/home2/viviennee which I run constantly including builds. From compiled libraries, executables, and also wine/x86 based software that creates a .folder in /home/vivienne. I really don’t think it’s the computer or Ubuntu but the process closing out Urho3D.</p>

<p>[quote=“weitjong”]I was <em>finally</em> able to reproduce the closing issue on my Fedora system with the previous revision. After the fix, it works now on my system. So, I thought it should fix yours as well. Just to be sure, I am referring to fix committed in revision <a  rel="nofollow noopener">github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/commit … e9e3572597</a>.</p>
<p>The build warnings seem normal to me.[/quote]</p>
<p>It didn’t so I leave it as a looming Ubuntu/Debian bug. I will focus on actually coding a app with a start screen.</p>

<p>Hi guys, just to help out: I’m also using a Linux VM and a clean system as well and I don’t have any closing out problems (terminal and windowed) with the version prior to the latest build. Vivienne, my guess is it might have something to do with your scene, graphic driver or how you have setup/build Urho3D.</p>
<p>Anyways, as you said you don’t really need to worry about it for now as this is really a small thing. <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/ab33f6c546ca85e7d84a4e3c32cd4034.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>

<p>I’m not sure. I completely did it the normal way. The samples work so I’m not certain if it’s that. It occurs even if it’s a new scene with nothing in it and pretty much the driver is used for Blender and online gaming. I’m assuming its something with the save configuration. That’s all I know.</p>

<p>I manage to figure out how to reproduce the issue after I followed almost exactly what OP has done. Install Urho3D to a local filesystem as root. As such all the executables are now owned by root but with execute permission for others. OP then invokes the executable in the /usr/local/share/Urho3D/Bin as a normal user. For me, I could only reproduce the closing issue when this is done when the current working directory is not writeable by user. If I invoke in my homedir then no issue. The revision prior to the fix attempts to create a log file in current working directory which fails in the former case. After the fix, all the executables shipped by Urho3D project creates log file in ~/.local/share/urho3d/logs (in Linux platform) regardless of current working directory. Other platforms get their different preferences path assigned by SDL. Previously I was also troubled by having the logs scattering all over the place, so this fix also scratches my own itch.</p>
<p>I agree that we should move on. I just hope that we will not hear a huge sigh or comment from OP regarding this again in his next video blog <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/ab33f6c546ca85e7d84a4e3c32cd4034.png" title=":slight_smile:"/>.</p>

<p>Lol. Don’t worry. No sighs. It just be a looming issue  that might pop up if another person have the same problem. Until then it’s a dead subject. I am glad it did help fix that little nag of having log files all over the place.</p>
<p>I probably sigh because I want to do a almost huge world terrain map seamless using the libnoise library with exportable world terrain. That’s a totally different subject.</p>
