<p>This is really weird.<br/>
It only happens in my game when the player dies while the monster attack animation plays, and the scene clears after attack animation ends and a the idle animation starts.<br/>
The scene clear is used for a level restart, removing everything and re-creating the scene.</p>
<p>The assertions seems to originate from components deleting things on destruction.<br/>
Each time it’s one of the following:</p>
<p><code>delete compoundShape_;</code> in ~RigidBody()</p>

<p>When AnimationController is destroyed, and <code>Vector&lt;AnimationControl&gt; animations_;</code> is destroyed.</p>
<p>If I don’t play the idle animation, the first kind of assertions stop happening (destruction ones), but I still get this assertion in asCContext::CleanReturnObject():</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Which originates from  ScriptFile::Execute().<br/>
I’m not sure but I think this one doesn’t originate from scene-&gt;Clear().<br/>
It also may happen when the idle animation is enabled but quite rarely.</p>
<p>I use a ScriptInstance on the scene node and have a script entry point “Main” class that derives from ScriptObject.<br/>
When the scene clears, the scriptInstance is removed, and when the level is reloaded a new scriptInstance is created. Maybe it causes problems with the script engine state?</p>
<p>I do derive a class from Script to register game level script API, could it cause this problem?</p>
<p>I’m using HEAD version (a2d8f8670e46565b74f1765c369f969c83cdf7c6)<br/>
VS2015<br/>
Windows 7 64bit</p>
<p>It seems like something went horribly wrong but I have no idea what.<br/>
And it only happens in that weird case of player dying while the monster AI is attacking and the scene is cleared after the attack animation is over.<br/>
If another animation starts after the attack is over it also changes the kind of error.</p>

<p>I tried to change the idle animation to the walk animation and the problem disappeared.<br/>
When I tried other animations it still happens, only the walk animation works.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the .ani is corrupted? I exported it from Blender using the Urho addon.</p>
<p>It still doesn’t make sense that the asserts only happen when a specific animation is played after the attack animation.<br/>
Maybe there’s a bug with the animation controller?</p>

<p>You should probably test your ani files first individually and verify if you have successfully exported them using Blender. The Editor is a good tool for that. Check also if you are using the correct animation layers.</p>

<p>It works, if an animation wouldn’t work on its own will be very obvious and trivial.<br/>
All the animations are on layer 0.<br/>
Like I said the weird part is that it only happens when the attack animation is played and then the other animation is played, and the scene clears.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br/>
I just tested it with just a model (no monster AI), and it still happens.</p>

<p>I just tested a potentially dangerous operation, clearing the scene from a script object’s method in the AnimatingScene sample (which plays animations), but it didn’t cause trouble.</p>
<p>My suspicion is on memory / heap corruption, but it’s hard to say where that is happening, it could be your code.</p>
<p>See if you can get a short reproduction case with for example only using scripting and the Urho built-in assets, if you manage that then please submit it as an issue.</p>
<p>We should definitely update AngelScript to newer at some point, it has improved a lot in the meanwhile.</p>

<p>Managed to replicate it in a project based on modified “04_StaticScene.as” using “Urho3DPlayer_d.exe”.</p>
<p>I’m using the same free model, which is this one: <a href="http://opengameart.org/content/lizardman-0" rel="nofollow noopener">opengameart.org/content/lizardman-0</a><br/>
It takes two animations, and jack only have walk animation.</p>
<p>I’ll pack it up, including the lizardman model and its blender file, and open an issue in a moment.</p>
