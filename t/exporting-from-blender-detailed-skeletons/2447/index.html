<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>As everybody knows, general character skeleton can contain lots of bones.<br/>
For example each hand is 20 bones each, head rig, hair rig, clothes rig, feet<br/>
are all quite detailed, and if we shortcut by reducing number of animatable fingers, etc. this is easily noticeable<br/>
by player. While many people say that “your player have too much time to notice things in your game” and<br/>
"you don’t ever need so many bones" are pure bullshit and lack of eyesight. We generally don’t make graphics for blind people,<br/>
and what other thing player do except watching out animations, even heavy on fight? Also to notice, not all genres contain fight<br/>
even.<br/>
So as I justified the need for &gt; 20 bones (<span class="bbcode-i">sorry for including the above part, but I really tired of explaining obvious things each time I ask about this problem</span>), how do we handle the problem? The actual skeletons can contain many bones,<br/>
the problem is bone-per-mesh value should not be &gt; 20. First I thought it was per <span class="bbcode-i">VertexBuffer</span> value, so I tried to cheat<br/>
using different materials, so having material groups split mesh, but that doesn’t work at all.</p>
<p>What works is actually <span class="bbcode-b">splitting mesh</span>. So if we split-out dense areas (hands, feet, head, …) we’re fine. And yes, that works.<br/>
But there is problem - visible seam, which happens because normal smoothing in Blender is disrupted by splitting.<br/>
The fixing probably can be done in script code if splits are done in places, where normals end-up quite close even after split,<br/>
i.e. when we split not at wrist but spilt forearm in half. This way we can detect same vertices throughout the meshes and averaging their normals (making them the same). <span class="bbcode-b">This is slow, though, and all the data is known at export time.</span>.</p>
<p>So the question is - why not autosplit the mesh in exporter? This should be easy enough. Also I think this can be done<br/>
by loader, too, or by engine tools. We know all bone groups, so we can split mesh by bone groups and then join closest in 20<br/>
counts. That would let me avoid doing routine work in Blender then slow work in script.<br/>
Doesn’t it sound like a good idea? Where to go with it?</p>

<p>This looks like a feature request with Blender Urho3D exporter. You can just post an issue to reattiva’s repo and make the request…</p>
