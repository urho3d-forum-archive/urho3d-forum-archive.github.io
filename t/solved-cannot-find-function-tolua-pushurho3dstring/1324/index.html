<p>Hello,<br/>
We are planning to use Urho3D as our game engine for a game and changing some stuff in engine code, move around code, rename files, functions and it all compiles perfectly.<br/>
But when it comes to generating and compiling the lua bindings, we get the compiler error that it cannot find function tolua_pushurho3dstring.<br/>
We have renamed this function in our engine to be PushLuaString but the generator still keeps on spitting out tolua_pushurho3dstring<br/>
We could not find this function anywhere in the repository, so is it hard-coded somewhere in ascii or something?<br/>
To work around this, we tried to use the -S switch in luabind.c but then the program crashes when a lua script file tries to use a string.</p>
<p>I think it is the luabind.c file which was generated before we made the changes to the engine. How would we generate this file again?</p>
<p>Edit: It was indeed stored nicely in ascii in luabind.c. But it would be nice to see how to create the bindings of these lua files.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I believe those are Lua bytecode (not ASCII representation of the Lua script). I have to keep a small note myself on how to generate these two files. The instruction is now included as part of the toluapp CMakeLists.txt. Knock yourself out.</p>
