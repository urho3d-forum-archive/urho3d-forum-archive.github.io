<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been trying to build Urho3D on my MacBook Pro, &amp; I got the following error :</p>

CMake Error at CMake/Modules/Urho3D-CMake-common.cmake:554 (message):<br/>
The configured compiler toolchain in the build tree is not able to handle<br/>
all the compiler flags required to build the project.  Please kindly update<br/>
your compiler toolchain to its latest version.  If you are using MinGW then<br/>
make sure it is MinGW-W64 instead of MinGW-W32 or TDM-GCC (Code::Blocks<br/>
default).  However, if you think there is something wrong with the compiler<br/>
flags being used then please file a bug report to the project devs.<br/>

<h2>– Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!</h2>
<p>I have some prior experience with Java, &amp; made some small games in Unity3D (C#) &amp; FlashPunk (Actionscript3), but I would like to try out Urho3D. As you can probably guess, I have no experience with C++ or Uhro3D.</p>
<p>Some details : MacBook Pro with freshly installed Yosemite OS, up to date XCode app (I plan on using this as my editor), successfully installed CMake, cloned master branch from git repository.<br/>
I was using the cmake_macosx.sh file as follows :</p>
<p>sh cmake_macosx.sh …/Urho3DBuild -DURHO3D_ANGELSCRIPT=1 -DURHO3D_SAMPLES=1</p>
<p>This created some folders and files inside my build dir (=Urho3DBuild), but left me with an empty ‘build’ subdir.<br/>
I’m clueless as to what I should do next. So, any help is very much appreciated !</p>
