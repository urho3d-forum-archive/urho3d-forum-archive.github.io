<p>Hi All.<br/>
I started developing a mobile game for android and I want to share the results already achieved.<br/>
Game - Beach volleyball.<br/>
This is the current stage:</p>
<div class="lazyYT" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque" data-width="480" data-youtube-id="3Rx5K7M3ja0" data-youtube-title='Second alpha version of "Hot Beach Volleyball"'></div>
<p>This is the screencast of the current alpha version of the game.</p>
<p>There is work on the playing according to the rules. While the bots simply beat the ball back with the addition of a random change to the speed of the ball. Worked the order of the serves, the presence of the goal, the change of the court, counting scores.<br/>
The game is up to 5 points with a matchball. After the victorious dance, a new party begins.<br/>
Video sometimes slows down due to the recording of the video itself. When the recording is not conducted, the FPS is stable 55-60.<br/>
Device Yotaphone 2 (2014 year, Qualcomm Snapdragon 800, Adreno 330, 2GB RAM), FullHD.<br/>
Just now you can not control characters, only pause game and move camera by joystick in pause state.</p>
<p>Who wants - can <a href="http://horovo-games.tk/files/bv-release.apk" rel="nofollow noopener">download apk</a>.<br/>
Models was created in Makehuman and Blender, animations are standard from mixamo.<br/>
In the future I plan to make mocap with kinnect for animation.</p>
<p>To raise funds for the game, I started a campaign on <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/beach-volleyball-game-sport" rel="nofollow noopener">Indiegogo</a><br/>
Please, if possible, share links to the campaign, so that as many people can learn about the upcoming game.</p>
