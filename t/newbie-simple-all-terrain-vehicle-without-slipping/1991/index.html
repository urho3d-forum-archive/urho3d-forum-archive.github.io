<p>I am trying to make a simple Vehicle travel over the Terrain. I have copied the code from the 19: Sample set.  But using this Vehicle it slipping and sliding on moderate inclines.  I guess the pure cylinders on the Terrain surface acts like glass surface, without any real surface area or grip to climb inclines.</p>
<p>I just want to model a simple ‘all terrain’ vehicle that can climb 40 degree inclines, without any slipping, toppling.</p>
<p>But when I set and experiment with different values for  Friction to 1.0, Rolling Friction =0.8f, Restitution 0.25f, Angular damping 0.285 etc etc for the wheel bodies, and Terrain surface, I still get slipping, wheelspins, toppling vehicles. I have also tried to apply normal downforce, based upon the Downforce model used in the 19: Vehicle Sample, so that Friction force should be higher.   Its getting frustrating, as UrHo3D API is so powerful, but also too complex to achieve game effects for newcomers.</p>
<p>Its all very complicated, when in Unity I can use Wheel Colliders and create a Vehicle pretty easily.<br/>
Is anyone aware of any alternative Tutorial settings or  Examples in Urho3D for a Vehicle models, or an equivalent  Wheel Collider models.</p>

<p>Hi JulesW, and welcome to the forum.</p>
<p>Lumak posted a nice vehicle Sample which may be a helpful study: <a href="http://discourse.urho3d.io/t/btraycastvehicle-example/1306/1">topic1354.html</a><br/>
I have not done much comparison, but it uses wheelFriction = 1000, which if analogous to your setting is much larger.<br/>
It also seems the suspension design gives better contacts.</p>
<p>Also, a more functional forum search might turn up other relevant information for you:<br/>

<p>As you note, Bullet simulations can take some tweaking.<br/>
(probably unrelated to your issue, but PhysicsWorld::FPS and Scene::timeScale can even change the apparent mass of objects in motion).</p>
