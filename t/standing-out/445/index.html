<p>Hello,</p>
<p>What might help is to get several groups of people? I am thinking of a some teams of 2 to 3 people to create specific types of games developing them. I mean the whole deal, a engine, graphics, and sound then post it here, Facebook, Youtube, etc, Iphone, Google play store.</p>
<p>The more quality indie games people see I think it might spark some interest.</p>
<p>Vivienne</p>
<p>Brainstorm</p>
<ol>
<li>Racing off-road game a few levels. (Portable to Iphone/Android)</li>
<li>A ground and space(inside a ship) exploration or combat.</li>
<li>Simple RPG on  a procedual world. (Portable to Iphone/Android)</li>

<p>I would like to also help if I can. However I am extrememly unreliable and have very little time. But I can do some angelscript and 3d stuff. Even though I am trying to learn blender, since i normally use not so free 3d packages.</p>

<p>If someone is interested, I finally up to the point of some serious coding on my Existence client. I got procedual terrain to work, rudimentary game state, ability to get some character customization, and environments possible indoor, outdoor, and space indoor. I think a possible ground indoor/outdoor exploration,  and space indoor/ground map can be done.  This is the raw runthrough of the latest version highlighting what I mentioned. Sorry I’m not talking did the video rushed a little.</p>

(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfYwrzn5zRU" rel="nofollow noopener">youtube.com/watch?v=yfYwrzn5zRU</a>)</p>
<p>I’m thinking the basic start would be some characters, game mechanic that can be networked in the future if desired, good indoor/outdoor environment, and space indoor environment, and some nice sound/graphics emphasizing the flexibility and strength of Urho3D.</p>
<p>Ideas<br/>

<p>If I may pipe in with my opinion…</p>
<p>If the objective is to create something as a community to show off some features of the engine, or even just to create buzz; it might be a good idea to do something on a smaller scale, and just make it as polished as posible.</p>
<p>I think that you have some great ideas viviennanthony. And I’ve wathced a few of your videos on your progress. And I think you have made great progress. In fact I would love to help on your project just to learn some of the things you are doing. However refering to what I am assuming the goal of this post might be, jumping onto that type of project might be largely ambitious. And please dont assume that I am trying to talk you out of your goals now. Not at all. Also as I mentioned about my self, I am speaking as someone with little time on my hands to even consider something of that scope for myself, or to try and group up with people willing to take it on. I would let everyone down.</p>
<p>Again, if my guess is close as to the purpose of this particular topic, my suggestion is to keep it very simple. If you want to drive traffic to urho, and if you have the help of some in the community, it might be best to start very small to see how the unit can move together. And with that success build something else. Obviously the comminuty is capable of coming together. It’s why the engine exists at all. But to grow the comminuty, maybe doing something like a 3d “heros of loot” or maybe something like a multiplayer “lovely planet”. Both in my mind using proc gen to build out a few levels to use some of the work you have done so far. MIght be easier to get something done well quickly. Well as quick as something like that can be done, which in my experience is never as quick as you want it to be.</p>
<p>Thats my 2 cents.</p>

<p>That’s fine. If someone had a idea of something small scale that would be great.</p>
<p>As for my project, I work on it when I can and  I know it’s slow and tedious. I have no problem working on it with others. It’s a learning experience for me most definitely.  Some of the things learned can probably in the future be forked into Urho3D. Lol. Basically a coding thinktank.</p>

<p>thats a really nice idea ^^ i am doing some small games for that purpose already. So i can learn game programming and Urho3d.<br/>
It would be nice to work on a small project with others !</p>
<p>few months ago, i did programm a maze generator with keys and locks, and the last two weeks i am experimenting with the 2d part of the engine. I have a simple 2d fighter game prototype and an 2d infinity runner game prototype ^^  so if you all want to programm somthing in 2d, i have now a little bit more experience in 2d.</p>
<p>we could do a game jam on <a href="http://itch.io" rel="nofollow noopener">itch.io</a> and the only rule is to use Urho3d ^^ that could be fun too …<br/>
and post it on <a href="http://compohub.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">compohub.net/</a> and other sites …</p>

<p>I was going to talk to leaf about doing an urho game jam <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/ab33f6c546ca85e7d84a4e3c32cd4034.png" title=":slight_smile:"/>  I was hoping to get the 2d tooling and 2d workflow up another notch before I brought up a game jam.  It is a really good idea.  A small piece of trivia is that I was part of the initial conversation about the compohub refactor and convinced the collective to take pull requests for hubs on a json file.  Leaf and I have talked about publish a jsonp api but there is only a very small interest in it <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/ab33f6c546ca85e7d84a4e3c32cd4034.png" title=":slight_smile:"/>  Oh vanity.</p>
