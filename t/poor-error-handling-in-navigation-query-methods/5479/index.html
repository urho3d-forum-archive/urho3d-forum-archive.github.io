<p>I noticed there’s a lack of appropriate error handling in the Navigation classes… the first thing I noticed was that NavigationMesh::FindPath has absolutely no error checking of return values, and itself returns void - there is no triggering of a statechange event that could inform us that a pathfinding attempt has failed. The next thing I noticed was that FindNearestPoint does something almost as bad - if it fails to initialize a query object, or fails to locate nearest polygon, it simply returns the input point - no error event is sent, and no useful error appears to be stored anywhere.</p>
<p>All that effectively means that if I try to find a path to a target point that is completely outside the bounds of my navmesh, I am greeted with silence, rather than “path not found”… and if I ask for the closest point on the navmesh to my invalid target point, I am handed back the same invalid point!</p>
<p>Just wondering how others may have approached the lack of appropriate error handling when making invalid navmesh queries…</p>

<p>Detour rarely returns any sort of meaningful error-code for us to do anything whatsoever with. In order for Detour’s <code>findNearestPoly</code> to actually say that it “<strong>failed</strong>” you have to give it garbage it inputs, otherwise Detour will always <strong>succeed</strong>.</p>
<p>Most of navigation runs into philosophical dilemmas about <em>“what is a failure?”</em>, crowds only have so much psychotic and overbearing error raising because DetourCrowd does have some sort of discernable valid state, unlike a random query.</p>
<p>So what then is failure for <code>FindNearestPoint</code>? Absence of a poly-ref from <code>dtNavMeshQuery::findNearestPoly</code>? What does that even rationally mean and what’s the ratio of genres where that would be an error to those that it wouldn’t be?</p>
<p>Since navigation is ultimately project specific, a lot of navigation just walks away from that problem and leaves it to the end-user.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I regret submitting the PR for detour-crowd. Objectively, none of navigation has any business being there at all and belongs elsewhere like a community repo so that it’s approached from the “<em>I’m going to have to fiddle with dials and tweak some code</em>” angle as it should be.</p>

Please feel no regret for your work with detour-crowd: its good work, I applaud and thank you for taking the time! I plan to make use of at least some of it!<br/>
The issues I refer to are based in the NavigationMesh class, not per se the crowd stuff built on top. I’m certain there’s a simple way to remedy this situation without going back to the drawing board <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/7bdd5ab4d67675d002d99e4b948c8cdb.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>

Sometimes I overlook things entirely, and at least to my mind, it’s not an attack on the system to point out where the system could be improved.<br/>
I’m not offering a solution, I realize it, I was kinda hoping someone else may already have addressed it, perhaps in some far flung fork, where it languishes, waiting to be rediscovered.</p>

<p>Me too - it works perfectly, when we request a target inside a safe volume, but we’re game devs, and the volume is never safe… just to see what would happen, I asked for a target outside the world. I got nothing - no errors, no replies. This is not good.</p>

<p>Games rely on robust rules, and so do we, game developers: programmers, artists, audio engineers, marketing people, we all live and breathe rules, but the rules can always give way to positive change. Here’s a sore spot though, because the query method, and the query reply structure, neither give us space to talk about who’s doing the asking. This makes it slightly harder to make a meaningful event to notify about this failure, without changing the return value, and breaking existing code. Sigh.</p>

<p>Certainly can give a use-case! NavMeshes are finite creatures, that may or may not be connected to others, via off-mesh links. Games on the other hand, particularly those with physics involved, are unbounded, and things will try to escape our world, with or without the help of the players.<br/>
If we are trying to track our way to something we want, that has left the nav mesh, and we are using nav mesh queries to do so, we are screwed - that is to say, we can’t seek a target outside of the navmesh in which the query began - whether or not its in a valid navmesh elsewhere.</p>

<p>I’ve begun to patch this issue, starting with the NavigationMesh class.</p>
<p>The two FindPath methods were returning void - since anyone already calling these methods was not expecting / using the return value, this meant it was “safe” for me to change the return type to dtStatus, and return a meaningful result (success, failed, or pending, but there’s actually a lot more rich information available in the status bits than that - see DetourStatus.h)</p>
<p>The FindNearestPoint method was already using its return value - so I tacked on an extra input argument, an optional dtStatus*=nullptr, which if valid, is used to return the status value from its call to navMeshQuery_-&gt;findNearestPoly. Adding an optional arg with a default value, again, does not break any existing code.</p>
<p>There were some subtle changes made to the code, mainly to return a failure code, instead of just exiting early. I also had to modify DynamicNavigationMesh.cpp already, just to make it include the dtStatus stuff, so that the NavigationAPI.cpp angelscript stuff stopped complaining.</p>
<p>I am not sure why, but NavigationMesh.cpp is including DynamicNavigationMesh.h, this seems like a backward arrangement, since the classes are related the other way around.</p>
<p>I’ve checked that my changes compile, and don’t affect existing code, but I’ll test them out before I take this any further - and by that I simply mean reflecting these changes in DynamicNavigationMesh.</p>
