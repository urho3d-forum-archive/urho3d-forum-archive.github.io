<p>fixed, a 100% my fault.<br/>
juggling of update orders is what got me. I was not calling the IK and or setting positions in the right place.<br/>
Fixed now…</p>
<p>[quote]After some digging it appears my initial diagnosis was incorrect. I believe that GetWorldTransform and GetWorldPosition are not to blame for my newfound issue.<br/>
But it’s something in my IK code… Updated question/pondering in following post.</p>
<p>[quote]I have a basic Ik set up that I have been successfully using for a little while…<br/>
It’ been disabled for a while since I was working on some other stuff.<br/>
Turned it back on tonight, and noticed some weirdness.</p>
<p>Using “HandleSceneDrawableUpdateFinished” event, every other frame it looks like I am getting invalid results. Not NANs, but inverted transforms is what it looks like.</p>
<p>I have a hierarchy of nodes, I am trying to get a child of a child of a child. It’s almost as if one of the parent nodes is at 0,0,0 in transform or rotation is when I get the bogus values.</p>
<p>This result is both the same for GetWorldTransform and GetWorldPosition.</p>
<p>I’m not sure the best way to confirm or replicate this, but wanted to put it out there in case someone has encountered the same thing, or has a simple test case.[/quote][/quote]</p>

<p>I’ve got a custom IK setup that has been in working condition.<br/>
It used some methods presented from this old post <a data-bbcode="true" href="http://discourse.urho3d.io/t/solved-ik-foot-placement/1010/1">http://discourse.urho3d.io/t/solved-ik-foot-placement/1010/1</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, the “HandleSceneDrawableUpdateFinished”, Which I am lead to believe/ blindly assume there were some changes that might have effected some of my GetWorldPostion calls, to get information on parent bones/nodes. (At least my first and second reaction is to blame the ( awesome) engine)</p>
<p>What is happening, that only on a few frames the math doesnt resolve and I get some frames that wig out, otherwise, all the other frames solve fine. I shall do more digging to try and pinpoint where the math fails, until then…</p>
<p>Again, I have no concrete examples, or proof. I come to the board in hopes that someone might be able to help me diagnose what might have changed so that I might fix this new issue i’m having.</p>
