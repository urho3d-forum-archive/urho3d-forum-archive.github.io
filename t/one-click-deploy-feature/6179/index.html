<p>We can see that other engines like JmonkeyEngine, Godot, RenPy have this content to export with a click. What I mean is: having the facility to export to any platform without having to recompile or having to find the binaries for each platform. In these engines we can export with just a window to platforms with their SDK or not (depending on the engine).Urho3D is able to do this? I’m crazy for a complete C ++ engine that I can write the code from scratch (c++ script?) but I don’t see this option here. Can I do this with CMake? If this is possible, could someone please explain to me?</p>
<p>@ Edit: how is to use Urho3D comparing to Unreal Engine 4, cause this engine uses c++, right?</p>

<p>TL;DR: No, it cannot.</p>
<p>Longer answer: 1-click deployment for C++ means that the engine should be able to properly execute build system from within itself.</p>
<p>Therefore, the engine should either contain <em>all</em> necessary SDKs and tools within, or require user to install them. First option is not viable for “all-built-from-source” project like Urho. Second option is… not really helpful. If you have to manually install exact versions of Android SDK, Emscripten SDK and whatever in order to do 1-click deployment, you can as well just make *.bat file that does exact same “1-click deployment”.</p>
<p>This process can be simplified a bit, but at the end of the day it’s won’t be that helpful.</p>
<p>Morever, C++ code cannot be built for iOS unless you run build from MacOS (AFAIK).<br/>
I have no idea how 1-click deployment is even supposed to work in this case.</p>
<p>If the engine is distributed in binaries, it doesn’t have this kind of problems at all (e.g. Unity).<br/>
If the engine is distributed in source… I have no clue. It either requires user to install 3rdparty SDKs manually or downloads their binaries automatically.</p>
<p>I don’t say it’s impossible to do. I just say that whole Urho infrastructure follow the opposite approach and Editor/BuildSystem rework is required in order to make it happen.</p>

<p>ditto on <span class="mention">@Eugene</span>. What you see in other engines is some form of “encapsulating scripting and the export your scripting”, the c++ is prebuilt and is always the same piece.<br/>
Urho has encapsulating scripting: many samples but especially the player in AS.<br/>
Auto building is not possible afaik. But you could aim for super-simplified build process, like with  <a href="https://github.com/floooh/fips" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/floooh/fips</a></p>

<p>Actually there might be some kind of one-click-deployments if you utilize dockerized build system.</p>

<p>Doesn’t really feel as easy/reliable way to build stuff. Also, linux only.<br/>
VM looks simpler to setup, and this is probably the way to go if one wants to build for iOS.</p>
<p>Both options are not really viable for out-of-the-box cross-compiling on iOS in one click, anyway.</p>
