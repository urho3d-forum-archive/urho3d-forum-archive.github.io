<p>I was unable to build Urho from source recently where not so long ago, it was no issue.<br/>
Using the “default” gcc which is 5.4.0. It appears to be related to this bug (I have not confirmed, this is just a guess): <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gcc-5/+bug/1568899">bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+sour … ug/1568899</a></p>
<p>I guess that because this is where the compilation failed:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">74%
/usr/bin/ld: ../../../bin/Urho3DPlayer: hidden symbol `__cpu_model' in /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/5/libgcc.a(cpuinfo.o) is referenced by DSO
/usr/bin/ld: final link failed: Bad value
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
Source/Tools/Urho3DPlayer/CMakeFiles/Urho3DPlayer.dir/build.make:95: recipe for target 'bin/Urho3DPlayer' failed
make[2]: *** [bin/Urho3DPlayer] Error 1
CMakeFiles/Makefile2:1516: recipe for target 'Source/Tools/Urho3DPlayer/CMakeFiles/Urho3DPlayer.dir/all' failed
make[1]: *** [Source/Tools/Urho3DPlayer/CMakeFiles/Urho3DPlayer.dir/all] Error 2
Makefile:149: recipe for target 'all' failed
make: *** [all] Error 2</code></pre>
<p>but urho was compiling fine on arch with the latest gcc. So I just decided to update gcc. <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/466651/how-do-i-use-the-latest-gcc-on-ubuntu">askubuntu.com/questions/466651/h … -on-ubuntu</a></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-6 g++-6</code></pre>
<p>instead of making gcc 6 the default when invoking cmake_generic.sh add the arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gcc-6 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++-6</code></pre>
<p>I was able to compile Urho3D the same as always.<br/>
The same was needed to compile my project as well, using Urho as a shared library.</p>
<p>Just wanted to put this out in the ether, incase anyone was trying to build the latest revision with vanilla ubuntu.<br/>
also thanks to carnalis for helping me through it as well.</p>

<p>This has been reported in <a >github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1499</a> too. Since it is a GCC bug, i.e. Urho3D can be built correctly in the previous non-problematic version of GCC, we could only accept the workaround to be incorporated into our build script when there is a check first on the range of problematic GCC versions. I like your “solution” better though as it does not require any change to the build script, however, some may not have the luxury to upgrade to GCC 6.0 now. BTW, I believe you can also use “CC” and “CXX” environment variables to point to your desired compiler toolchain, be it GCC or Clang to workaround this problem.</p>
