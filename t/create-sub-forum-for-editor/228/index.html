<p>Hey ,<br/>
it will be very logical to add sub forum for the editor , as it is big component by it self and keep get bigger .<br/>
so questions can be found and asked easily<br/>
( based on other engines forums )</p>
<p>also , i didn’t understand and its always confuse me , what is the difference between the sub forums :<br/>
Support, and General Discussion  in both Engine and Engine related questions been asked …  ok maybe there are some Questions in the General support that are really general<br/>
maybe good idea just to Consolidate them both to something like "Engine Discussion " or just rename the “Support” forum to “Engine support”</p>

<p>Our intent is to have a only  few subforums for readability,<br/>
otherwise we should have “General”, “Feat request” , “Support”  for each component, you can add a label to specialize a thread.</p>
