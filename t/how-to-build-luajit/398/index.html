<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Well, maybe another future tutorial. For the moment, i’m stuck.</p>
<p>The Urho3D build with -DURHO3D_LUA works like a charm (except it’s slow, relative to C++ or AngelScript samples).</p>
<p>Then I’ve decided to build Urho3D with LuaJIT support.</p>
<p>I tried with these parameters:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">./cmake_gcc.sh -DURHO3D_LUA=0 -DURHO3D_LUAJIT=1</span></p>
<p>I get no warnings for x86 (native) build, but for Android:</p>

<p>Just which part of the above sentence is not clear to you? I was the one who put those sentences together. Sorry for my bad English. Basically, what you need to do after receiving this message is to build the missing ‘buildvm-android’ tool before proceeding with Android build. How to build the tool?</p>
<ol>
<li>This tool (as well as all the other tools) should be built natively. By native, I mean your normal build (i.e. when target platform system is equal to build/host system). For your case, you need to run ./cmake_gcc.sh one more time. The script will reconfigure your existing native Urho3D project to build this new tool natively.</li>
<li>cd Build &amp;&amp; make to actually build it. Note that it is “Build” directory (native). Verify the buildvm-android executable is created in “Bin” directory.</li>
<li>Now you have the tool built, call the ./cmake_gcc.sh one more time to reconfigure for your Android project. It should not complain again and should configure your Android project with LuaJIT enabled.</li>
<li>cd android-Build &amp;&amp; make.</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>BTW, why we did all this is because we have hit CMake technical limitation in cross compiling build. The good old Makefile is able to handle such cross compiling cases much better, as can be seen in the original LuaJIT Makefile. This is as automated as we can come up with using CMake. At least it works to enable LuaJIT for these cross compiling targets: Android and Raspberry-Pi using Linux build system or for Android target only using Windows build system. In theory we could also make it works for iOS target too, but we didn’t because of Apple policy.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thanks for providing help one more time.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about your english, it’s more a problem with my own understanding.<br/>
With your additional explanations, it’s easier for me to understand.</p>
<p>Reading the script output i posted, i had understood that i had to build something related to <span class="bbcode-i">buildvm-android</span>.</p>
<p>After doing a <span class="bbcode-i">find</span> on this file, i’ve found that it was related to LuaJIT. Then i scratched my head, wondering ?so i have to build LuaJIT part for building LuaJIT ??</p>
<p>I searched in the generated Makefile (in <span class="bbcode-i">ThirdParty/LuaJIT</span>) if there was an entry dedicated for <span class="bbcode-i">buildvm-android</span>, but found nothing. Then i posted here.</p>
<p>I had not understand what was the meaning of <span class="bbcode-i">native build</span>. Now it’s ok, i guess.</p>
<p>So if i understand well:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>i have to launch <span class="bbcode-i">./cmake_gcc.sh</span> with <span class="bbcode-b">native</span> parameters (ie those for Linux 64 bits x86).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then i got this warning (?you have to build buildvm-android?): I must launch again <span class="bbcode-i">./cmake_gcc.sh</span> with same parameters as above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cd Build / make.<br/>
(after checking that <span class="bbcode-i">buildvm-android</span> is in Bin)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To be sure, i did a complete clone of the project with git.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
 ~/sources/Urho3D$ git clone https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D.git
</code></pre>
<p>Then, i’ve cleaned cmake cache (not needed, but just to be sure).<br/>
And i gave parameters for a <span class="bbcode-b">native build on Linux 64 bits x86</span>. I’ve put URHO3D_EXTRAS and URHO3D_TOOLS to be sure to include needed 3rd parties.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
 ~/sources/Urho3D$ ./cmake_clean.sh 
 ~/sources/Urho3D$ ./cmake_gcc.sh -DURHO3D_64BIT=1 -DURHO3D_LUA=0 -DURHO3D_LUAJIT=1 -DURHO3D_EXTRAS=1 -DURHO3D_TOOLS=1 -DURHO3D_LIB_TYPE=SHARED
</code></pre>
<p>So i get the same message i’ve posted above.<br/>
I relaunch immediatly the last command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
 ~/sources/Urho3D$ ./cmake_gcc.sh -DURHO3D_64BIT=1 -DURHO3D_LUA=0 -DURHO3D_LUAJIT=1 -DURHO3D_EXTRAS=1 -DURHO3D_TOOLS=1 -DURHO3D_LIB_TYPE=SHARED

<p>Hmmm still warnings?<br/>
Well, let’s try a build.</p>
<p>As i got a strange bug with the cpufreq governor on my laptop (sure, it needs a reboot after 42 days of hibernation cycles), my cpu cannot go beyond 0.6 Ghz.<br/>
I tell you this for explaining why i jump directly to LuaJIT directory, instead of doing a full build.</p>
<p>So at the beginning, all seems to go smooth.</p>
<p>But is still hangs like the last time.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I’ve decided to try to compile LuaJIT for Android, apart from Urho3D.<br/>
Just for seeing if i encounter the same problems.</p>
<p>So i’ve downloadedl last sources from LuaJIT website.</p>
<p>I’ve followed the instruction given here: <a href="http://luajit.org/install.html" rel="nofollow noopener">luajit.org/install.html</a></p>
<p>I can compile others Android programs (I’ve compiled Lua without problems).</p>
<p>The interesting thing is <span class="bbcode-i">i have the same compilation (linking in fact) problems</span> than when i try to <span class="bbcode-b">buildvm-android</span> with Urho3D.</p>
<p>To be accurate, these are not the same libs involved with Urho3D buildvm-android (see my previous post in this thread). But i’m sure the problem is the same.</p>
<p>So i think if i manage to compile LuaJIT on my own, i can sort out the Urho3D buildvm-android problem.</p>
<p>I use this compilation script:</p>

<p>I am taking a long shot at this. It is caused by your host operating system. Are you using 64-bit Debian or Ubuntu? I guess that the error: “/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu” means the linker was looking for 32-bit version of the library but found a 64-bit one. Remember that at the moment when you targeting Android platform, your build is always 32-bit. This is also true when you build Urho3D for Android platform regardless of the URHO3D_64BIT build option that you pass.</p>
<p>My recommendation. Get a 32-bit Debian or 32-bit Ubuntu when you want to build for Android. Or, get a 64-bit Fedora but install both 32-bit and 64-bit software development packages. If my guess on why you got this problem in the first place is correct then in theory you should be able to install 32-bit devel packages into your 64-bit Debian/Ubuntu and it should also solve your problem, however, that would or might whack your 64-bit part out for good in your host system (speaking from past experience using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS VM). In my opinion Debian-based distros still do not have good multi-arch support where the same 64-bit host system has both 32-bit arch and 64-bit arch libraries coexist. Not intended to start a flame war here but 64-bit Fedora system does a much better job at this kind of scenario.</p>

<p>Strange thing is that i had no problem compiling and linking Lua for Android on same computer.<br/>
It seems that there are several problems which stack up <img alt=":frowning:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/2506cac83464f3f86e257fa414340d4c.png" title=":frowning:"/></p>
<p>For the moment, i give up on compiling LuaJIT for Android.</p>
<p>Anyway, as friesencr said, the most important is to have a game to run. That’s not the case for me now, so i’ve to do that before.</p>
<p>It will be time for optimizations after. For the moment, Urho3D seems to package well at least Linux, Windows and Android. With Lua support and that’s the most important for me. In the worst case, i guess i can extend Lua with a small C unit, for heavy-duty computations (ahem.)</p>
<p>Thank you for answering, always a pleasure to have support  <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/c16ddadcbd525aa6d219a1df596d362f.png" title=":smiley:"/></p>

<p>I don’t want to end this discussion while leading other forum readers to believe that building Urho3D library with LuaJIT enabled is difficult. As I said it before, the process is almost all automated by our CMake scripts that one just have to:<br/>
[ol][li] Carry out the configuration in the right order. For cross compiling target such as Android, one have to deal with configuration for not 1 but 2 projects: a) native project to build the necessary tools and b) Android project to build the library itself. [/li]<br/>
[li] Have a build/host system with all the compatible prerequisite software installed for the intended target platform.[/li][/ol]<br/>
Lastly have a closer look on the Rakefile and .travis.yml. It has all the bits to instruct our CI Server to test build Urho3D library with LuaJIT enabled on most of the supported target platforms. My own 64-bit Fedora build system can do the same feat without any sweat  <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/c16ddadcbd525aa6d219a1df596d362f.png" title=":smiley:"/>.</p>
