<p>Qt LGPL license is not a problem as long as you link dynamically. Because of its size and involved build process, it’s not a good match for a Urho core dependency, but for user applications it’s a perfectly fine choice.</p>

<p>Can’t speak for others, but I have given myself permission to not comment one way or other if something doesn’t particularly interest me. In this case you’ve met a bit of bad luck. You could consider just going directly to PR and see if you get stronger reactions then. If the existing real-time profiler (within Urho window) functionality gets broken, then that is a negative, which would point against merging it.</p>

Another argument against Qt other than the LGPL license is that it isn’t standard C++ with the use of MOC.[/quote]<br/>
A common, and wrong, misconception about Qt.</p>
<p>From the author of moc himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have read this many times, but this is simply false. The macros understood by moc to annotate the code are simply standard C++ macros defined in a header. They should be understood by any tool that can understand C++. When you write Q_OBJECT, it is a standard C++ macro that expands to some function declarations. When you write signals: it is just a macro that expands to public:. Many other Qt macros expand to nothing. The moc will then locate these macros and generate the code of the signal emitter functions, together with some additional introspection tables.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that your code is also read by another tool than the compiler does not make it less C++. I’ve never heard that you are not using vanilla C++ if you use tools like gettext or doxygen, which will also parse your code to extract some information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recommend the whole article, it debunks most of those old myths: <a href="https://woboq.com/blog/moc-myths.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://woboq.com/blog/moc-myths.html</a></p>
<p>But anyway, I also got that this is just about the node editor the OP posted.<br/>
Speaking of which, I do like node editors for graphical work, so that is nice.<br/>
What I found utterly horrible is stuff like Unreal Engine’s Blueprints.</p>

<p>I just think they are extremely inefficient, lead to horrible code (I saw the code some of those produce when compiled) and become completely spaghetti-like for any real project.<br/>
You cannot beat the efficiency of just writing code.</p>
<p>They might be fine for prototyping, and are easier to get into than learning to code (I’ll never agree that clicking together nodes is programming) but that’s about it.</p>
<p>Of course, there are exceptions, like material editors, or what Iogram does.<br/>
But those work only because of the limited complexity.</p>

<p>Personally, I use this node based editor <a href="http://algoholic.eu/qnodeseditor-qt-nodesports-based-data-processing-flow-editor/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://algoholic.eu/qnodeseditor-qt-nodesports-based-data-processing-flow-editor/</a> as it was the easiest to adjust to an external arbitrary graph and the cleanest in implementation (even if I wasn’t a fan of the code).

<p>Code production is arguable. I won’t weigh in there, but it can be done well. At least I’d like to think my approach does it well. (bias alarm)</p>

<p><span class="mention">@TheSHEEEP</span> Yep, I mostly agree. I think it is a big mistake to try to implement a programming language in a node editor. While functions actually work quite well, logical flow and variables are horrible! Having to use 4-5 nodes just to do a simple comparison or sort is no good…although kind of a necessary evil when using such a platform.</p>
<p>However, I disagree that node editors can’t be used for complex things - in fact, I think they are often better at that sort of stuff than doing simple things. Depends a lot on the implementation, though. Also, I think it <em>should</em> be possible to get decent, human readable, source code out of a node editor. It’s something I’m researching.</p>

<p>Also AI stuff is good with node editor.<br/>
The main reason these exist is to allow non-programmers to write some logic.<br/>
There are some data structures like behavior tree, which go well into node concept.<br/>
Also stuff like animation trees. If done well, these structures cooperate well with<br/>
written code, but you do not consider these structures as code per se, just some<br/>
data structure with nice editor. Making something serious (i.e. algorithmic code) with<br/>
node editors is proven ineffective a long time ago, node editors should operate with high-level<br/>
task-specific content. But if done right, these tools are very useful.</p>
