<p>I was wondering what the logic behind the name “StaticModel” is? As a user coming from Unity, I keep expecting the MeshFilter (the asset you want to display), MeshRenderer (the class that handles materials, and other rendering options) pattern. Would this pattern make sense in Urho?</p>
<p>Some other specific questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is “static” about a StaticModel? For instance, the DynamicGeometry sample implies that the way to create procedural geometry is to modify the vertex/index buffers of a StaticModel, which to me seems counter intuitive.</li>
<li>I should probably just test this on my own, but is the Model easily swapped out of the StaticModel? That is, can I simply point the StaticModel component to a different Model and have it render it?</li>
<li>If yes to the above, then what is “model”-ish about a StaticModel?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is pretty minor point, but it’s something I’ve been thinking about. My usage of Urho involves lots of runtime geometry creation/user control of what’s on screen, so this comes up often.</p>

<p>Static as in not skinning or morphing. The class names talk about built-in Urho functionality; if you use access on the vertex buffer level you can animate a StaticModel as much as you wish.</p>
<p>The filter / renderer separation is not really needed in Urho, as the “filter” part in Unity is basically just storing the mesh resource attribute. Call StaticModel::SetModel() if you want to change the model resource being rendered.</p>
