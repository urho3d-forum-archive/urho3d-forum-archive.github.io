<p>Hey guys, Iâ€™d just like to confirm something about the order of component initialization.<br/>
I found that, due to some subtle dependencies in my current project, that after Loading a scene, I would have to do a bit of housekeeping to fix up broken pointers etc. (mainly weak refs to other components).<br/>
I figured that the perfect place to do that was in the DelayedStart method.</p>
<p>Can anyone confirm that the virtual DelayedStart method on Logic components is executed in the same order that the components appear in their scene hierarchy? And can I assume that I have an iron-clad guarantee about the order in which components will be processed generally?<br/>
I know that Update and FixedUpdate are called at different rates, but what of the order that components receive events?</p>
