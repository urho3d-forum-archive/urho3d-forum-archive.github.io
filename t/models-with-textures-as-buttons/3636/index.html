<p>I need to create a UI with nodes and models with textures as buttons, this is because I want access to the Actions that the nodes benefit from as well as materials - for this my plan was to create a ray picking component and keep track of time and calls ‚ÄúRaycastEnd‚Äù on my target to perform a button action of some kind - just like the UI Button is doing it right now.</p>
<p>Is there already somewhere a component that will allow me to make nodes/models behave as buttons?</p>
<p>EDIT:<br/>
I am currently following this pattern until something else happens :D:<br/>

<p>Follow-up question:</p>
<p>I am adding a child node with a model to my camera Node only I can‚Äôt seem to be able to see it rendered. I tried various positions and rotations with no results. Are the camera children nodes ignored when rendering?</p>
<p>EDIT: Looks like this might be a monologue thread:</p>
<p>The camera component seems to be outside the scene and it‚Äôs children are not rendered because there is no octree outside the scene:<br/>
