<p>Hi gvnarendra! Welcome to the Forum!</p>
<p>You have downloaded the sourcecode for Urho3D - for the sake of clarity, lets call that the ‚Äúmaster‚Äù folder. The master sourcecode is meant to be ‚Äúplatform agnostic‚Äù - it‚Äôs a blueprint that we can ‚Äúunroll‚Äù for a specific target machine and compiler‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs going to help us to create a project that targets our chosen compiler, so we can build urho3D using our compiler and target platform of choice.<br/>
One way to proceed is to use CMAKE to generate a ‚Äúbuild folder‚Äù from your ‚Äúmaster‚Äù - this is essentially a C++ Project for a compiler of your choice. You said ‚Äúexe‚Äù - can I assume you‚Äôre using Windows? Do you have Visual Studio installed? Choose it in CMAKE as your target compiler.<br/>
Once you have generated a ‚Äúbuild folder‚Äù, finally, you can build the Urho3D Project (in the build folder), which will generate a folder called ‚Äúbin‚Äù (in the build folder), which contains your Executables. It will also create a folder called ‚Äúlib‚Äù, which contains the lib file for use in your own projects, assuming you choose not to use the ‚Äúplayer app‚Äù (see bin folder).</p>

<p>Do you think this is a right answer here???<br/>
When you go to a bakery and ask for a cake they give you a cake or how to bake a cake???<br/>
Do you like this example? I really do not understand what is happening to this project. Wrong decision after wrong decision.<br/>
Why I have to spend lot of time to understand how to build it? I don‚Äôt need to know. i only need binaries. static or shared library and that set. not prepare 3 different machine to cover all the builds for all platforms.</p>
<p>If you cannot help or do not have a correct answer for a question. I suggest you to do not write anything.</p>

<p>I am a bit confused as to your reply. I think helping users understand how to build the library (teaching to fish) is very useful, as users will have to build their game, which is generally a similar experience. I think a fairer analogy (unless you only intend to use scripts for your game) is that you can make a cake (your game) from a packaged mix and other ingredients, or you can skip the packaged mix and make that part as well (build Urho as well). The skills and tools needed between the two aren‚Äôt very different, it‚Äôs just a little more tedious to make your own mix (build Urho) than to get it prepackaged one, but you have more flexibility in what goes into it (e.g. disable unused engine components).</p>
<p>As to the builds, I think you only need 1 computer if you have a Mac. I‚Äôm pretty sure cross compiling for Windows and building for Android works from it, in addition to the obvious builds for OSX and iOS from it. I know it does from Linux at least. If you don‚Äôt have a Mac, it‚Äôs Apple that makes it difficult. I would welcome a solution to that as well.</p>
<p>If I‚Äôm wrong about that in the present feel free to correct me.</p>
