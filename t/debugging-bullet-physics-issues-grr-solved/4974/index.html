<p>I didn’t see any CollisionShape::GetCollisionShape anywhere (I’ll doublecheck) but my point was really about debugging collision callbacks - where we are handed a bullet CollisionObject that we can cast back to a bullet CollisionShape - but from there, we’re screwed, we can’t cast back from there to an Urho CollisionShape or RigidBody given a bullet object of those types. Bullet objects have a “userpointer” which is often used for this purpose, but I don’t think we’re setting it - this means there is no way to, for example, obtain the Name of an object involved in a collision, because we can’t get hold of any Urho objects from within a collision callback - therefore we can’t get to the parent Node to query its name.</p>
<p>[EDIT]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Urho’s RigidBody class has no GetCollisionShape method - given an urho rb, we have to query the parent node for the CollisionShape component (which we assume is attached to the same node as the body). But having done so, Urho’s CollisionShape class DOES have a GetCollisionShape method to expose the underlying bullet object - so accessing bullet objects from urho objects is definitely possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both Urho RigidBody and Urho CollisionShape ARE setting UserPointer on the underlying bullet objects. Therefore, it is also possible to cast back from a bullet object to an Urho object!</p>
</li>

<p>[EDIT AGAIN]<br/>
It is noteworthy that although Urho’s CollisionShape class provides a GetCollisionShape method, the same cannot be said of Urho’s RigidBody class - there’s no way to access the underlying bullet rb from an urho rb.</p>

<p>After a LOT of debugging, I was able to determine the exact source of my problem.<br/>
There is a bug in XML deserialization of Urho3D RigidBody - or rather, a problem with the notion that RigidBodies are instantiated, and attached to the scene, PRIOR to attribute deserialization, so the attributes are never applied to the bullet objects…</p>
<p>When I construct my scene in code, I call RigidBody SetLayerAndMask on every rigidbody that I create. I then save the scene, and note that these values are correctly serialized to xml.<br/>
Then I load that same xml file back into my app.<br/>
At this point, my rigidbodies are constructed and attached to the new scene with default layer and mask values (-1). But the attributes are never deserialized, or if they are, they are deserialized incorrectly : the default values are being used, and certainly, no attempt is made to call SetLayer, SetMask, or SetLayerAndMask during deserialization.<br/>
If deserialization is correctly reading the values back in, well, the rigidbody was attached with default values, and we probably need to “re-add” rigidbodies just after we deserialize the layer and mask attributes, in order to have our deserialized values applied to the bullet objects.<br/>
I’d say this issue is squarely in Urho’s court <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/33cb8d9bf277cdb113680cf5564b6764.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>

          <div class="post_content">
<p>Part of the problem was RigidBody::reAddBody_ flag has a default value of false. When loading scene from XML, the value will also be false by default… this causes a failure in RigidBody::ApplyAttribute().<br/>
So I made the following minor change to force attributes to be applied:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">    //if (readdBody_)
        AddBodyToWorld();</code></pre>
<p>Now I was able to see for certain that all my rigidbodies had the correct layer and mask values after deserialization. But a problem remained when I performed my raycast!<br/>
In my character class, the following line of code is causing me problems:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">        phyWorld-&gt;RaycastSingle(result, ray, CollisionFilter::Static);</code></pre>
<p>The value of the mask for the raytest (CollisionFilter::Static) is 2. But when I debugged this call to PhysicsWorld::RaycastSingle?</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">void PhysicsWorld::RaycastSingle(PhysicsRaycastResult&amp; result, const Ray&amp; ray, float maxDistance, unsigned collisionMask)
{
    URHO3D_PROFILE(PhysicsRaycastSingle);

    if (maxDistance &gt;= M_INFINITY)
        URHO3D_LOGWARNING("Infinite maxDistance in physics raycast is not supported");

    if(collisionMask==(unsigned)-1){
        URHO3D_LOGWARNING("ERROR! RaycastSingle called with Mask=Everything!!!");
        // Generate an interrupt
        std::raise(SIGABRT);
        }</code></pre>
<p>This trap is triggered - what the hell? I passed in a constant integer value of 2, yet somehow that argument’s value has become -1!!!<br/>
My callstack in this call is showing different values to what I expressly passed in!<br/>
It is noteworthy that I perform some other raycasts in a different method of the same class, passing in the very same mask value, and they don’t trigger this trap.</p>
<p>Could this be a compiler bug? Or even a bug in GDB debugger?<br/>
Here’s what I get when I debug the call:</p>

<p>Finally figured it out!</p>
<p>Some of my raycast calls were missing a maxDistance argument!<br/>
This meant that maxDistance was set to my input mask value, and the mask value used in the call was the default M_MAX_UNSIGNED value.<br/>

</aside>
<p>doesn’t seem right. It’s enought to have a quick look at the rigidBody source to see that when attributes (collision mask and layer also) are loaded, ‘MarkBodyDirty’ is called and this method sets ‘readdBody_’ to true and therefore when attributes are applied AddBodyToWorld is called, so Your minor change (commenting out readdBody check) should make absolutely no difference.<br/>
Right now I don’t have much time to check this closer, but i made quick efford to reproduce Your problem by simply loading ninja object (it’s serialized with rigid body) and it seems that everything is working as expected, readd flag is changed when loading, AddBodyToWorld is called on ApplyAttributes.</p>
