<p>Ah that looks cool. Can you share the code for that? I made a platformer with animations but I feel that the animation code is not done properly. Urho’s CharacterDemo is using an AnimationController, are you using that too like in that sample?</p>

<p>Hmm, it’s not so much the code but the animation set that I bought from the unity store. Luckily, the set that I bought had “InPlace” and “RootMotion” sets, and I used the RootMotion set to extract displacement per frame and convert that to velocity.  And yes, I’m using 18_CharacterDemo code with AnimationController.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Good question, but the question is very broad.  I haven’t looked at every asset being sold at the Unity Store to know if any one of those are restricted to used with Unity only.  I can tell you that everything that I bought had no restriction to Unity only.  I’ve also looked at assets from Unity Essentials, made by Unity, and those have no license.  Most asset license that I bought typically read something like: “royalty free, world wide, for any number of games or applications.”</p>
<p>If you aren’t sure if the license has a restriction to Unity only, you should visit the publisher’s site and see.  Kubold for example states in their license:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>4. You can use the animations in any game engine, you are not limited to UE4 or Unity.</p>

<p>Of course they can’t change the copyright but they can disallow certain license terms of stuff published on their site. As it seems they only allow one of four licenses to choose from when publishing stuff on the store.</p>

<p>Ok, thanks for the links. The submission guidelines 6.2 refers back to “Asset Store Terms of Service and EULA.”  It’s clear to me that there’s no restriction about having to use Unity game engine for 3rd party assets.<br/>
I wonder if, rather, doubt Unity will offer 3rd parties an exclusive license to restrict the assets to be only used by their engine/platform.</p>

<p>Let me cover how I incorporate the RootMotion in my character demo.  It’s a very simple process.</p>
<p>Using the jump animation as an example, I extracted the Hips/Pelvis node key frames from RootMotion, which is this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Jump animation AnimationKeyFrame - total frames = 17
frame= 0, t=0.0333, pos(0, 0, 0)
frame= 1, t=0.0666, pos(0, 0.0957, 0.3708)
frame= 2, t=0.1000, pos(0, 0.2871, 0.6140)
frame= 3, t=0.1333, pos(0, 0.4306, 0.7775)
frame= 4, t=0.1666, pos(0, 0.5941, 0.9131)
frame= 5, t=0.2000, pos(0, 0.7297, 1.0328)
frame= 6, t=0.2333, pos(0, 0.8533, 1.1484)
frame= 7, t=0.2666, pos(0, 0.9251, 1.2521)
frame= 8, t=0.3000, pos(0, 0.9530, 1.3877)
frame= 9, t=0.3333, pos(0, 0.9650, 1.5113)
frame=10, t=0.3666, pos(0, 0.9490, 1.6229)
frame=11, t=0.4000, pos(0, 0.9171, 1.7505)
frame=12, t=0.4333, pos(0, 0.8533, 1.8781)
frame=13, t=0.4666, pos(0, 0.7656, 2.0337)
frame=14, t=0.5000, pos(0, 0.5742, 2.2091)
frame=15, t=0.5333, pos(0, 0.3150, 2.3726)
frame=16, t=0.5666, pos(0, 0.0837, 2.5241)</code></pre>
<p>Secondly, keep track of curPos and prevPos each frame using a similar method found in <span class="bbcode-b">void AnimationState::ApplyTrackFullWeight()</span><br/>
and acquire deltaPos = curPos - prevPos;</p>
<p>Orient the deltaPos in character orientation:<br/>
Vector3 vDisplacement = body-&gt;GetRotation() * deltaPos;<br/>
Knowing vDisplacement and timeStep, calculate linearVelocity = vDisplacement * (1.0f/timeStep); and just call rigidbody-&gt;SetLinearVelocity();</p>
<p>I also turn off gravity during the jump motion to get an exact match of the animation (the animation already accounts for gravity).</p>

Yes, you move the rigidbody with linear velocity.  So the body and the character will be in sync.  If you play the rootmotion in the game, the animation character will out of sync with the body.</p>

<blockquote>

The character’s position changes by matching rigidbody’s position, as mentioned above. Manipulating rigidbody’s linear velocity is similar to applying ApplyImpulse(), the character will naturally follow the body in the system. I turn off/on the gravity using an animation trigger file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One caveat to implementing this displacement mover is you’ll need to smooth out the camera.  I’m still working on tweaking mine.</p>

<p>the best way is extracting the motion of root bone offline and the store the motion vector in animation resource, my way is modifying the animation in script after the animation is loaded.<br/>
the difficult part is animation with rotation or root motion bone is pelvis(the bone has the motion is no the root bone but with local rotation and position)</p>

<p>I actually do something different than how I describe others can do this w/o having the need for Maya (currently using Maya 2016 LT), and I place a Displacement joint in my animation and the information is exported and embedded in an .ani file.<br/>
I can imagine it’ll be difficult to duplicate the animation movement if there’s rotation involved.  But from the looks of your animation sample videos (Cat Woman/Batman), I think you did an awesome job with that.</p>

<p>a special joint is a clever way of doing this kind of thing, I can imagine that even animation triggers can be stored in this way without making any urho3d specific exporter but just with normal FBX exporter.<br/>
since all the animations are stolen from the batman arkham games, and there are tons of crazy animations, I don`t want to modify the original data one by one, so just made a batch way in script after all the animations are loaded, the extracted part code are also learned from the RootMotionComputer.cs from unity site.</p>

<p>About the Unity Asset Store license:<br/>
<a href="https://unity3d.com/legal/as_terms" rel="nofollow noopener">unity3d.com/legal/as_terms</a><br/>
Under “ASSET STORE END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT”, 2.3 there are 2 restrictions which are annoying:</p>
<ol>
<li>The license is valid only for 1 physical location. If you need it for several offices or working with people online it would mean each place need to buy a license.</li>
<li>It requires all computers that use the assets to have appropriate Unity license.</li>
</ol>
<p>Theoretically you can use assets from the Unity Asset Store, but you’ll have to have Unity licenses.</p>
<p>The best option is to try to check the seller’s profile to see if they have their own website and find if they sell on other stores with sane licenses.<br/>
After going over the licenses of many stores I recommend CGTrader for 3D models, they have nonsense-free license.<br/>
For other resources there’s <a href="http://market.envato.com" rel="nofollow noopener">market.envato.com</a>, but their 3D store license is 1 use license so I don’t recommend it, but their sound/video/graphics have unlimited use license.</p>
