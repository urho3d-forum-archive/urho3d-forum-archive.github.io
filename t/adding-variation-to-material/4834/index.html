<p>A quick overview indicates that they are doing the trick of sampling a texture twice, with different UV scales for each sample, then combining them together. It looks like they sample the floor texture at normal UV and at UV * 4, then multiply again by an arbitrarily-chosen color to try to correct the color which is altered by the multiplication. This technique was discussed somewhat in the old <a href="https://api.unrealengine.com/udk/Three/TerrainAdvancedTextures.html#Multi-UV%20Mixing:%20Reducing%20tiling%20through%20scalar%20mixing" rel="nofollow noopener">Unreal Engine document</a> about terrain texturing as the Multi-UV mixing technique.</p>
<p>After multi-UV mixing, they then sample another texture, multiply it against the previous result, then they mix this multiply result with the original UV-mixed sample with a mix factor of 0.5</p>
<p>Note that multiplying a texture sample by itself has a tendency to increase the saturation and can potentially reduce the brightness of a texture, hence the constant-color multiplication your linked article performs. Also, while UV-mixing can reduce the occurrence of local repeating patterns, repetition still exists at the level of the larger-scale UV sampling. One way of getting around the color-changing issue is to lerp/mix the multi-UV scale samples, rather than multiply them. For example, here is a texture mult-sampled at 1x and 4x scales then multiplied:</p>
<p><img src="//cdck-file-uploads-global.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/2X/b/b8105d03ea01fe6fa1a959f984b9d305217a24c3.png"/></p>
<p>Top left quarter is the base texture at UVx1, top right is UVx4, and bottom half is the result of multiplying them.</p>
<p>Now, here is the same texture with a 1/2 mix rather than a multiply:</p>
<p><img src="//cdck-file-uploads-global.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/2X/0/0b41d06ad1723d1ca3d0e4e2d3d93b8d355ade33.png"/></p>
<p>You can see that this method preserves the overall coloration of the source texture. This is the method that I perform in my terrain editor; you can see some of the results <a href="https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/u3d-terrain-editor/765/81">here</a>. If you choose the scale of your larger UV sample carefully, you can use this trick to hide repetition; just be aware that repetition still exists at that larger scale.</p>

<p>[Repetition still exists at that larger scale] It sure does, I used similar tricks in a realtime terrain painting demo, where you could choose the weights and textures on your brush, but could not avoid the fact that I was still tiling textures in a regular way across the terrain</p>

<p>That was a very detailed answer, <span class="mention">@JTippetts</span>! Thank you so much for the attention and sharing the knowledge.</p>
