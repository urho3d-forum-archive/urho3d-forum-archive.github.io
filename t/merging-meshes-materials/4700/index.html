<p>Greetings, friends. I am writing another minecraft clone and I want to combine the blocks into a single object. I want to make the union not by chunks, but “each with a neighbor” when placed. The architecture for this solution has already been invented and implemented, it remains to “write one function” <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/33cb8d9bf277cdb113680cf5564b6764.png" title=":slight_smile:"/><br/>
I read this forum, but have not yet understood where to start.<br/>
What is now incomprehensible:</p>
<ol>
<li>how to combine meshes? Are there any tools for this or do you need to do it manually?</li>
<li>Is it possible to use different materials? That is, is an object possible with a single mesh and different materials in different parts?</li>
<li>How to apply a texture to the resulting complex structure? Generate a large texture dynamically (I am doing this for cubes now) or is it possible to impose a texture separately on each face?</li>
</ol>
<p>ps I have never done 3D before. I’m writing the last three weeks <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/33cb8d9bf277cdb113680cf5564b6764.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>

<p>Not following your first paragraph.</p>
<ol>
<li>I have a collection of <a href="https://github.com/JSandusky/Urho3DProcGeom/tree/master/ProcGeom" rel="nofollow noopener">procedural geometry helpers</a>
<ul>
<li>Those should show you how to work with the raw geometry functions</li>
<li>It’s easier if you can just define a known <code>vertex struct</code> instead of working with raw buffers</li>
<li>Basically you have to transform and concatenate the vertex/index buffers in order to merge meshes
<ul>
<li>there isn’t a function to do that in there, but I could add a limited one that requires identical vertex layouts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each mesh in a model gets a single material, there’s no fixed limit on the number of meshes in a model
<ul>
<li>you can work around that in a pixel-shader (like the terrain splat shader does)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Options:
<ul>
<li>use an atlasing scheme and set the UV coords for each face</li>
<li>use texture arrays and an encoding scheme such as UDIM</li>
<li>use multiple meshes in each model, one for each material containing only the faces relevant
<ul>
<li>because of depth-test this isn’t as <em>bad</em> as it sounds, still not great, but not terrible</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, couldn’t quite follow your first paragraph so this next paragraph might be irrelevant:</p>
<p>Ideally however you don’t do this by merging geometries. You should really be using some kind of surfacing algorithm, whether naive or greedy meshing (see the <a href="https://0fps.net/2012/06/30/meshing-in-a-minecraft-game/" rel="nofollow noopener">0fps articles</a> if you haven’t already gone through them, they’re reasonable introductory material.</p>
