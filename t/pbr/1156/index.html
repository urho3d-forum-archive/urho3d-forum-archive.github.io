<p>I’m deciding between Panda and Urho and i wanted to know if Urho supports deferred rendering and PBR, like Panda?</p>

<p>Urho3D supports deferred rendering. PBR is not currently supported. But since Urho3D lets you set custom shaders for both the G-Buffer filling pass and the deferred lights themselves, and it supports custom G-buffer layouts, there’s no reason you couldn’t implement it yourself, no source code changes necessary. The flexibility of Urho3D’s rendering system was a big draw for me. You can pretty much do anything you want with it, as long you don’t need geometry shaders, tesselation, or compute shaders.</p>
<p>That new Panda3D rendering system looks fantastic, though. I’ll need to check that engine out. The only issue is that it requires OpenGL 4.3, at the moment.</p>

<p>I feel the metalness/roughness method is probably the better direction, and is the direction I would take my work. It’s definitely a large amount of work for one person to do, between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic surface shader (forward and deferred) and all the possible techniques</li>
<li>Extended shaders like hair, terrain, vegetation, skin, wetness, alpha</li>
<li>PBR lights</li>
</ul>
<p>Extra features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>parallax corrected cubemapping</li>
<li>Reflection probe and blending</li>
</ul>
<p>I took a shot at a few of those things, but it would need a lot more love to get it where it should be.</p>

<p>Cheers for the Panda3D link! That could be a great base to work from for Urho3D albeit it targets the highest high-end deferred-only. Bumping the GL version from 3.x to 4.3+ at startup time with a flag could be done though, with graceful fallbacks.</p>
<p>The Panda3D codebase is quite epic though, I would rather just extend Urho3D with these same features than go into the C++/Python combo (Python is absolutely excellent for tools dev, I would never ever use it in a game runtime though). Is it true it’s like 40 mins to compile Panda on a modern rig???</p>
<p>I’m biased towards VFX so I’d go spec/roughness vs roughness/metallic at least for the working set of files, although it’s a smaller memory footprint with the latter.</p>
<p>I would really like to see how area lights could be incorporated to keep it more physically plausible, but I think producing shadows for these lights you need either raycasting in compute or a voxelised scene to cone trace.</p>

<p>As another python coder, I already tried Panda3D and Tobias’ RenderPipeline build. RenderPipeline is still experimental so I would not bet on it to make serious or mid size PBR based games yet, it is great for tech demos though <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/95940790c23d98635b2a6d3f22657158.png" title=":wink:"/>. The build time is really slow (vanilla Panda3d) and could take as much as a couple of hours if you include all options, which is the default. Sources and generated files also  huge around 8GB total.</p>
<p>There were large scale and established MMO games with Panda3D so I would say it’s really another great engine.  <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/c16ddadcbd525aa6d219a1df596d362f.png" title=":smiley:"/></p>
