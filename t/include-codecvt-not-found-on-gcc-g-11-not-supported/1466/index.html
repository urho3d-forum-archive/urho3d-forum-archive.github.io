<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I  am trying to compile the ODBC support. I’m getting  <span class="hashtag">#include</span>   not found error. I’m using GCC and G++ above 4.8 which isn’t the case. Codecvt is not standard across platforms. So, I am wondering if even stumbled on this problem. I’m using Ubuntu 12.04, Gcc 4.8+, G++ 4.8, mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.5.46, unixodbc 2.3, and  cmake version 3.3.2</p>

<p>BTW, I have no idea or don’t see why adding those lines in CMakeLists.txt would have caused this. Perhaps it has something to do with what you have in that directory.

If I were you I would double check the final source list, lib dependency list, etc being added into this target. Most likely that is the reason why the linker complained.</p>

<p>BTW, I have no idea or don’t see why adding those lines in CMakeLists.txt would have caused this. Perhaps it has something to do with what you have in that directory. That globbing of source code using a file pattern could be a double-edged sword some time. If I were you I would double check the final source list, lib dependency list, etc being added into this target. Most likely that is the reason why the linker complained.[/quote]</p>
<p>I spent some time trying to isolate the problems and I downloaded the latest nanodbc.</p>
<ol>
<li>The newest version had  some code specific to Microsoft ODBC(Probably the 2.2 installed on the Urho3D github 2.2 version). I removed those specific functions because it’s not required to make it more non-platform specific.</li>
<li>Used some of the original of the updated version nanobc cmake information into the Thirdparty/nanobdc/CMakeList.txt(probably spelt wrong) to build and additionally add to the Urho3D library</li>
</ol>
<p>Updated my GCC/G++ to 4.81, Cmake 3.3, Clang 3.3.2, libboost 1.48 and when compiling nano  C++11/c++03 turned on depending on the compiler.</p>
<p>It built  including the DatabaseDemo which crashed I think because I didn’t move the resource folders.</p>
<p>So, it then compiled. I’m not certain about the SQLite aspect but I think it probably compiles fine because that was tested.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have been working on the ODBC as mentioned. This is a zip file of the plain Urho3D build</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jp26tq84wk34k2t/Urho3D-MasterCurrent1.4.zip?dl=0" rel="nofollow noopener">dropbox.com/s/jp26tq84wk34k … 4.zip?dl=0</a></p>
<p>Vivienne Anthony: I updated my GCC and G++ above 4.8 and my Cmake/Clang above 3.3. I updated the the thirdparty Urho3D nanodbc to the latest version with minor changes. Also the latest Boost development files with the locale header. Using this line I was able to build  Urho.</p>
<p>./cmake_generic.sh build  -DURHO3D_64BIT=1 -DURHO3D_SAMPLES=1 -DURHO3D_EXTRAS=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DURHO3D_DATABASE_ODBC=1 -DNANODBC_USE_BOOST_CONVERT=ON</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/pcMUUsgh" rel="nofollow noopener">pastebin.com/pcMUUsgh</a></p>
<p>I also tried</p>
<p>Now with the following lines. I had some better results. I am thinking id the cmake detects boost, updated compiler, and a few flag changes. It would work in a Linux/MinGW cross-platform build</p>
<p>export MINGW_PREFIX=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32</p>
<p>./cmake_mingw.sh buildWin  -DURHO3D_64BIT=1 -DURHO3D_SAMPLES=1 -DURHO3D_EXTRAS=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DURHO3D_DATABASE_ODBC=1 -DNANODBC_USE_BOOST_CONVERT=OFF -DMINGW_PREFIX=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32</p>
<p>I am confident that the .bat files or other files in the first example would produce 100% compile but honestly a few changes(minor) after troubleshooting.</p>
<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/pLRC7kZy" rel="nofollow noopener">pastebin.com/pLRC7kZy</a></p>
<p>So, both Linux and Windows builds can be made.</p>

<p>Despite the nanodbc release version appears to have a big jump, there are really nothing much changed since the last time I check (the version we currently have in our master) with their latest version. The rather significant improvement is only in the area of async SQL execution which will only be available if the ODBC driver manager installed in the system supports ODBC 3.8. Since our database subsystem does not take advantage of any new features available in ODBC 3.8, there is not much incentive to upgrade to this latest release version. Having said that, I have attempted to merge the upstream changes in order to see if everything is still building. It is not, however, at least on my Linux host system. I have spotted bug(s) in their code in regards to async execution and will probably submit a PR to upstream later. Your Ubuntu probably only have ODBC driver manager that only support ODBC 3.0, so your build did not see any issues.</p>

<p>It supports 3.8 I think. I might be wrong. The problem is the platform specific Async code which makes no sense for multiplatform  compiling. Although there might be no major updates with the two versions of nanodbc. I decided to go with the higher which has the detection of boost and codecvt (which is compatible with all platforms). At least with boost and codecvt detection. It leaves some room for just in case.</p>
<p>I’m curious to know what bugs you spotted. I’m going play with mine version with the latest code and put more/ better platform detection to allow cross-platform or multi-platform compiles within Urho library.</p>

<p>No, the unixodbc in Ubuntu 12.04 only defaulted to 3.51, or otherwise you will hit the bug also. As I said before, Ubuntu 12.04 is too ancient to be supported anymore. Any recent distros with GCC 4.9 or above should be able to handle nanodbc without boost library just fine. As you may have already noticed, I actually do not use the original CMakeLists.txt from nanodbc library. I will be probably continue to do that which means I probably won’t include the bits that would integrate the boost library part. As for the bugs, try to make a build on a more recent distros yourself.</p>

<p>I made a library that builds in the lib folder the same folder of libUrho3D. I tried to modify and look at the FindUrho3D.cmake to a version like FindEngineStd.cmake.</p>
<p>I am having no luck with looking at the cmake file and going to the cmake website for help. The source code .cpp and .h files are located in Source/EngineStd.Then headers are placed in  {build folder}include/EngineStd and the usual {build folder} include/Urho3D.  Maybe you can sport some error.</p>
