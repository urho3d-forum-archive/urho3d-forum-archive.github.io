<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m working on an offline lightmap baking system using Blender Cycles.<br/>
I have to face a batching problem, and I don’t know how Urho’s culling work in order to make the right decision. Here’s the problem:<br/>
To use lightmaps another UV map and texture are added to the material.<br/>
In order to minimize the number of diffuse textures per lightmap I want to group the geometry with the same diffuse texture, so I get less combinations of diffuse &amp; lightmap.</p>
<p>The thing is, I wonder how Urho3D is culling based on location.<br/>
If I simply group geometry with the same diffuse texture into a single model, the geometry can be spread all over the level and the model could have a huge AABB. Will it cause performance problems?<br/>
For optimal performance, is it required to group the geometry based on location too?</p>

<p>Your mileage is going to vary with vertex count and screen space consumed. Culling order is Octree-&gt;Frustum-&gt;Occlusion (I could be wrong though, and I don’t believe occlusion is used for everything such as shadow casting lights etc). It’d work though.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Are the octree/frustum/occlusion per triangle or per model?<br/>
If some of them are per object, not grouping based on location will make them useless.</p>
<p>Also what do you mean by “implement lightmap support directly”?<br/>
I remember that the lightmap technique uses the emmisive slot for the lightmap texture.<br/>
How does the renderable sorting thing works in Urho?<br/>
I’m guessing it means you order the order of the rendered models by lightmap so they’re batched together?<br/>
My current plan is to generate the materials in real-time.<br/>
Does Urho3D batch models by material by default?<br/>
If so is there an advantage for doing the batching your way?</p>

<p>All culling is per-object, not per-triangle.</p>
<p>The rendering will sort object drawcalls based on material, to minimize state changes, and also uses hardware instancing automatically for same object + same material combinations, to reduce draw calls. But it doesn’t perform any vertex buffer manipulation to combine dissimilar static objects together into the same draw call.</p>

<p>There are some code paths that will cause a drawable not be drawn.  Camera/Object viewmask, object draw distance come to mind.  There are a few states I have produced in my own code where I was missing data in components and they were invalidated during the view rendering phase.  I have not of set the number of batches or didn’t have a vertex stream or didn’t set the world bounding box or something like that.</p>
