<p>Today, we were experiencing some crazy behavior in Shader, seeing the uniform variables being overwritten by some outside force.     It would work for a while, but then would start messing up reliably after about 30 seconds of panning around our map.</p>
<p>After trying everything else, we finally figured out that changing “register(b6)” to “register(b5)” worked, miraculously (and we see no other side-effects yet from this).</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#ifdef</span> COMPILEPS<br/>
cbuffer CustomPS : register(b5)  &lt;== changing this from (b6) to (b5) FIXES the issue.<br/>
{<br/>
bool cShowRelief;   &lt;== this parameter alone GOES HAYWIRE, sporadically. (gets overwritten?)<br/>
float cAlpha;<br/>

float cAltThreshDanger;<br/>

<p>Questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there any reason why we can’t/shouldn’t use register b5?</li>
<li>Does anyone have any clues as to why register b6 could have some sort of cross-talk/overwriting occurring?</li>

<p>Update, the following change ALSO fixes our issue, combining the final two uniforms into a float2, as follows:</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#ifdef</span> COMPILEPS<br/>
cbuffer CustomPS : register(b6)<br/>
{<br/>
bool cShowRelief;<br/>
float cAlpha;<br/>
float cOwnshipAltitudeFt;<br/>
float2 cThreshHolds;     &lt;=== combined cAltThreshWarn/Danger into a float2, also fixes this.<br/>
}<br/>
<span class="hashtag">#endif</span></p>
<p>This is making no sense to us.   Anyone got any clues?</p>
<p>Luckily this final workaround does work, so we’re going to “go with it”.</p>

<p>If we ignore a possibility of driver bug messing up with packing bool into uniform buffer… I don’t know. Perhaps Urho messes up parsing such layout, I dunno.<br/>
It’s hard to tell without actual GPU debugging (I prefer Visual Studio debugger, which is still quite trash)</p>
<p>Personally I would have just avoided using bool uniforms alltogether. You have floats and integers.</p>

<p>FYI – I encountered this same behavior again tonight – only impacting HLSL.   One Shader’s parameters overwriting another’s.   This time, I’m not making any sense of it.     One way to fix it is to have a single fake float constant defined (that I don’t even use) – and for some reason this clears up the issue.</p>
<p>It works fine in GLSL.   After hours of playing around with this – still no real progress, other than figuring out a kludge that seem “seems to magically work” for this one instance.</p>
<p>Here’s the shader that is failing:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">#ifdef COMPILEPS
cbuffer CustomPS : register(b6)
{
    uniform float4 cColor;
    //uniform float cBOGUSPARAMETER; // Adding this, fixes the issue, otherwise "cColor" is overridden by crosstalk from another shader.
}
#endif

void PS(
    float2 oTexCoord : TEXCOORD0,
    out float4 oColor : OUTCOLOR0)
{
    float4 diffColor = cColor * Sample2D(DiffMap, oTexCoord).bgra;
    oColor = diffColor;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Does anyone have any clues as to what might be causing this?   It seems like an Urho bug to me, at this point.</p>

<p>I spent another 4 hours trying to find the pattern to this – and turns out it’s worse than I thought.   I could make this error happen in a great many situations – all HLSL.   The fix to issues were all nonsense stuff (like above) – but at least these kludges work.   And so we can move on.</p>
<p>This bug exists in UrhoSharp, not <a href="http://Urho3D.NET" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Urho3D.NET</a> – because <a href="http://Urho3D.NET" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Urho3D.NET</a> uses OpenGL on Windows, and so avoids usage of HLSL entirely.   And so I’m going to just live with the silly workaround, and we’re glad that this workaround actually works.</p>
