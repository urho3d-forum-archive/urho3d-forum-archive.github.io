<p>I’m wondering what the “Urho” way would be to implement the following behavior:</p>
<p>Say I have an Object at Position A. I would like to move it to Position B. But, I would like this move to happen smoothly over, say, 100 frames.</p>
<p>So here are some thoughts:</p>
<p>[ul]</p>
<ol>
<li>Ideally, I would like to emulate Unity’s Coroutine architecture.</li>
<li>I’m familiar with the WorkQueue. However, my understanding is that it is not safe to modify scene too much from a threaded function, so while the above example might work, in general, this is not the way. And in fact, as I write this, I’m pretty sure that using a WorkItem wouldn’t help anyway…</li>
<li>There is most likely a way to do this by implementing some behavior in the Update loop. But this is a bit ugly IMO, since you end up with a bunch of code in your Update loop that is only rarely used. For instance, you would write something like:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(shouldMove)
{
 if(!IsAtTarget())
 {
  StepTowardsTarget(target, stepSize);
 }
}</code></pre>
<p>But this check needs to happen every frame, regardless of whether or not you want to move. Better would be to have a function that can yield control back to the main thread…<br/>
[/ul]<br/>
Unless I’m missing something (which is likely <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/ab33f6c546ca85e7d84a4e3c32cd4034.png" title=":slight_smile:"/>) it seems that such behavior is a bit of a hassle to implement. I’ve done a bit of reading on how to implement coroutines in C++, but I’m no expert, so all input is welcome. I know that Boost has a coroutine module, but, well…I’m not sure if I want to include Boost in my projects.</p>

<p>Like you observed, using the WorkQueue is certainly wrong for this kind of task.</p>
<p>Some things that come to mind is using ValueAnimation, or writing your own manager to which you can submit objects/attributes to be modified over time, or object methods to be called periodically. The manager would listen to frame events, freeing your per-object update code from having to do that. The ScriptInstance (AngelScript) already provides a delayed or delayed repeating method call mechanism.</p>
<p>Actual coroutines go against pure C++ which cannot readily manipulate the actual CPU stack (you could use assembly, or setjmp/longjmp, but that goes easily into nonportable or crashprone territory.)</p>

<p>K, thanks!</p>
<p>I think the manager idea is probably the way forward in my case. It seems like it should be possible to make this reasonably general. Maybe something like the WorkQueue/WorkItem, but on the main thread. The WorkItems have a function pointer and some configuration data, like a stopping condition, etc…</p>
