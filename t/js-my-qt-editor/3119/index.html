<p>Edits: fix ephemeral links.</p>
<p>Because I have seen an increasing number of stars/watches etc on my QT based editor at <a href="https://github.com/JSandusky/UrhoEditor" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/JSandusky/UrhoEditor</a> I’m starting this thread so that persons interested can be aware of what is going on and where it is as well as state their items of concerns.</p>
<p>Superficially it looks like it’s been static … but it really hasn’t been.</p>
<p>Recently I have been exploring avoiding data-binding in order to minimize the woes of GUI programming. Because I use the same code-base for that QT editor and a different project it is often difficult to reconcile the two. A lot of potential is lost in dealing with the data-binding woes of retained GUIs. Reconciling Core Urho3D and “my version of Urho3D” has been unpleasant to say the least. Never mind that I intend this toolset to be usable outside of Urho3D.</p>
<p>In trying to find ways to make exploratory efforts and easier UI I gave IMGUI paradigms a shot. For this I turned to Nuklear as it has a draw scheme that fits QT whereas IMGUI does not (barring writing a barycentric-rasterizer in QT … good luck with that).</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox"  rel="nofollow noopener" title="QI97XxX.png"><img alt="Nuklear in QT"  height="368" src="../../../images2/87c9c368f04c737a38ad84273af2a6d5.png"  width="690"/><div class="meta">
<svg aria-hidden="true" class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">QI97XxX.png</span><span class="informations">1920×1024 264 KB</span><svg aria-hidden="true" class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>The results were excellent. While Nuklear’s widgets are very janky, I’ve already put in the effort of making several of them (text edit and slider) less janky and more usable. I will continue to do so for other widgets as is viable.</p>
<p>In the UI pictured above there are more than 1k draw commands being issued to QPainter per IMWidget (6 of them) and there is no consequence on the real-time performance of the viewport. It’s viable … that’s just a debug build.</p>
<p>Once the editor is bound to AngelScript I believe that this approach will give Urho3D users the same editor powers that Unity users have … if not much more by virtue of having the source.</p>
<p>Progress has been happening, even if you don’t see it in github. So many options are opening up, prepare for an influx - this is a geyser.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why no CMake files?
<ul>
<li>CMake hates QT, it was a shit-storm to compile Aster’s QT particle editor on windows via CMake, a complete shit-storm … it just doesn’t work - you’ll get things working faster doing it yourself</li>
<li>CMake falls on its face when dealing with code generation, this project will very quickly encounter automatic reflection scenarios that require code generation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I do not consider Nuklear suitable for Node-graphs … I’ll be exposing the node-graphs used for the texture graph editor in a couple of weeks. Node-graphs really do need to be retained, they’re systems of often absurd consequences.</p>

<p>This has definitely been the right choice so far. After implementing “hotspots” (areas that indicate mouse cursor, repaint needs, and tooltips) in Nuklear I’ve eliminated 90% of unnecessary repaints and I’m interacting more closely with QT. Once I slap in QIcon/QImage support it’s basically as done as it can get.</p>

<p>IMWidget now provides adequate helper methods that return true/false as to whether or not the value was actually changed (taking the value by reference/pointer). Out of the box Nuklear doesn’t care … and was never really designed for scenarios where the consequences of a “false edit” could be substantial (in my case that means rerunning contouring, regenerating bone weights, regenerating UV coordinates, and lastly regenerating textures … not a fast enough process to have happen for false edits).</p>
<p>There’s still a lot to do to catch up with where I was at with pure QT and custom QT widgets, but it’s looking very promising. At this point, nothing can be as bad as the hell I went through to make combo-boxes happen through Nuklear in QT.</p>
<p>That bit of work, for not having to care about what undo/redo does, is priceless. By the end of tomorrow, I’ll know for sure when I dive into collections and curves whether this is the right way or the wrong way … but since collections drove me here (the tree on the far left of the image is also an IMGUI-style widget, just a custom one I wrote designed for tree/list/layer scenarios) I suspect it’ll go well (uses a similar hotspot based model, which I’ve used before for real-time report editing [column widths, fonts, etc]).</p>
<p>And I’m using crap-hardware (Surface Pro 1 - Intel HD4000) to judge what’s okay and what is not.</p>

<p>I couldn’t have been more wrong about Dear-IMGUI. With just a little bit of evil (of the slap a bunch of structs in a union variety) it was an easy job to write a backend for a pure QT scenario.</p>

<p>What’s going on in the above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dual-contouring is running at 60fps in OpenCL (not a lot of cells though, it’s just a ball)
<ul>
<li>Which is just a stupid stress test to be running constantly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Urho3D is rendering at 60fps the slightly late results of the contouring</li>
<li>A custom immediate-mode tree is painting every 50ms</li>
<li>2 Instances of Dear IMGUI context are running the Dear IMGUI demo
<ul>
<li>Both @ 50ms refresh rate</li>
<li>They’re 100% freestanding from each other (stylable independently, etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Old QT based property editor is sitting there, flashing a cached paint image like QT does</li>
<li>Nuklear is running the same property editor as the above
<ul>
<li>Updating @ 50ms</li>
<li>Not visible but there’s embedded QT widgets in the Nuklear IMGUI instance for dealing with tricking situations like combo-boxes … they are very unhappy about being embedded in an IMGUI</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>I’ve settled on my direction now.</p>
<p>Nuklear was promising but it was going to be a lot of work to bring it up to something livable for extended use. Extensive swathes were going to have to be torn out and replaced in order to make TAB/SHIFT+TAB’ing through the UI viable globally … that’s pretty much required for anything you’re going to use regularly.</p>
<p>Code for the base of Nuklear stuff in QT: <a href="https://gist.github.com/JSandusky/71b50cd7addf7daea02060f25a0f18b1" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/JSandusky/71b50cd7addf7daea02060f25a0f18b1</a> (IMWidget.h/.cpp is what you’re really after, most of the Nuklear file changes are just “make me happy changes”).</p>
<hr/>
<p>So I gave Dear-IMGUI another look and it pretty much fell right into place (most likely because I had just done similar with Nuklear).</p>
<p>DearIMGUI really won me over. There’s a bannana-ton of OSS already using it (if you need something special you can probably find something you can slap into a lambda, toss the widget in a dock, and be done), I had to write fewer helper methods, and it’s sufficiently well-behaved and well-written to be easy to match the places QT widgets are still used without creating a jarring experience.</p>
<p>A bit more work tying it all into QT for drag/drop, embedded QT widgets, and making sure my image/icon caching from the Nuklear stuff wasn’t incredibly dumb/misguided and it’s off to the races.</p>

<p>Sort of, the two live together mutually. QT is still responsible for the main ‘shell’, OS dialogs and dialog shells, as well as drag/drop and clipboard data … and obviously all of the QT goodness (QDir, QFile, QXml, etc … the stuff where QT really shines for mostly working everywhere). Most likely QT will remain responsible for settings/configuration as well.</p>
<p>IMGUI popups though are … interesting. I use QT for tooltips but there is witchcraft in handling the pop-ups.</p>
<p>Running an IMGUI inside of QT probably seems odd to some but it’s actually eerily similar to what we used in MFC at a previous employer for multiple chem/safety products, only real difference is we were slightly more clever with painting in ways that make no sense with an IMGUI.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In the idealogical sense? The ‘viewport’ and all the other data-files are the most important thing. Just “redoing the Urho3D editor in QT” is silly as it’s there and it does in fact work. I consider core editor functionality + brushes to be the mandatory minimum.</p>
<p>Ideally, I’d like to do <em>run-within-editor</em> as long as the project follows “fashion XYZ” - though I haven’t really looked at what that will really entail, not the slightest idea. Extended usage over “usage” basically, an example of that policy is that all <em>Mask</em> / <em>Flag</em> attributes have settings for naming each of the bits - showing the bit-name in a tooltip or in a side-by-side popup that lists all of the bits by name.</p>
<p>In a more life/push-cycle sense before “and now it’s safe to actually fiddle with”? Wrapping up this IMGUI stuff, then pushing it all out. It should be much more approachable once the heaps of custom controls have been eliminated - much less noise to distract.</p>
<p>I could go on and on.</p>
<p>If you’d like to hop onboard I’d certainly appreciate the help. I’m on this full-time for the next couple of days so the latest should be in git relatively soon. If you’re too gung-ho to wait, screwing around with CMake + QT to confirm whether I’m just an idiot or not would be super helpful … it’s wayyy back on my todo list and actually effects viability to non-Windows folks - or ‘shell’ sketches as I’m still not sold on the ribbon for how much real-estate it eats.</p>

<p>It’s based on ofxManipulator, painting is done through Urho3D::DebugRenderer, I only tweaked it for alpha-blend. There’s <a href="https://github.com/CedricGuillemet/LibGizmo" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">LibGizmo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/CedricGuillemet/ImGuizmo" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ImGizmo</a>, and Sony’s ATF LevelEditor gizmos are pretty convenient to use. Technically the subject matter is “direct manipulation” … not that it matters since that doesn’t actually help googling. I’ll inevitably ditch it for something less cludgy.</p>

<p>Although the Resource cache and Profiler are accessible through the debug HUD having them in GUI eliminates the screen space constraints so that the profiler can show <strong>everything</strong> and all resources from the cache (plus their reference counts) can be viewed … which is pretty useful.</p>
<p>They’re both really just <em>baseline</em> widgets. There’s room for a lot more stuff going on in the Resource cache widget (<a href="https://gist.github.com/JSandusky/f684a0be15984c84ed1e59d13a166538" rel="nofollow noopener">CPP file for resource cache widget</a>) such as forcing dumps/reloads/OS-thumbnail-previews/etc (though the whole ResourceDirs thing makes OS thumbnails a big “WTF do I do” or I’d have done it already for rule of cool).</p>

<p>I’ve been pushing out periodically over the past couple of hours. The latest pushes include everything pictured above. The scene tree has fully moved over to repeater now. And those release build issues should be gone.</p>
<p>I’ll be returning to the property editor for completeness. After that I’ll be rounding out the missing functionality from the Urho3D scene editor. I expect to have all core functionality there by next weekend.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@Eugene</span>, and anyone interested in helping out, now that core stuff is pushed out it’s viable to tackle specific types of documents (particle effects, materials, etc) (see <a href="https://github.com/JSandusky/UrhoEditor/blob/master/EditorLib/DocumentBase.h" rel="nofollow noopener">DocumentBase</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JSandusky/UrhoEditor/blob/master/UrhoEditor/Documents/Urho/BaseUrhoDocument.h" rel="nofollow noopener">UrhoBaseDocument</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/JSandusky/UrhoEditor/blob/master/UrhoEditor/Documents/Urho/UrhoSceneDocument.h" rel="nofollow noopener">UrhoSceneDocument</a>). Pre-empt your document’s global property page in <a href="https://github.com/JSandusky/UrhoEditor/blob/master/UrhoEditor/Documents/Urho/UrhoDockBuilder.cpp" rel="nofollow noopener">UrhoDockBuilder</a> ahead of UrhoIMPropertyEditor’s addition (or add index/priority support before I do). Do what you have to do for your sanity, it can always be amalgamized later.</p>
<p>If any build issues are encountered please raise a Github issue for it so I can fix it. CMake scripts are inbound, though they will require environment variables and potentially single line fixes for your use. Those scripts aren’t a cross-platform bullet though as the InputManager for the viewport, video-card/CPU stats, and thumbnail reading are all OS specific things that require support elsewhere.</p>

<p>I’ll be carrying through for the week, but I expect to drop this completely soon. QT is absolutely pathetic compared to MFC in many ways. QT is designed for single document type scenarios and completely falls on its face when presented with multiple document types.</p>
<p>Essentially, I have to write MFC on-top of QT to make anything sane and not tightly coupled as QT is the epitome of tight coupling with signal/slot. It cannot cope with ephemeral existences, it does not work well with undo/redo (nothing in QT does), etc.</p>
<p>Whereas in MFC, no one actually uses it like you think they do. All shipping cases are closer to DearIMGUI. We just use CWnd and the other helpers, and do everything else ourselves … that’s how it has always been.</p>
<p>I’m going to give replicating CCmdUI in QT a whirl, if it works great, but if it doesn’t this project is dead.</p>

</aside>
<p>Quite honestly, all of this just sounds like you don’t know how to use Qt.</p>
<p>If you want undo/redo in any kind of editor that goes beyond simple text, you will have to implement it yourself.<br/>
Which you can do with Qt as well as with every other library. Hell, to my surprise, Qt actually offers undo/redo functionality out of the box: <a class="inline-onebox" href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qundo.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Overview of Qt's Undo Framework | Qt 5.15</a><br/>
And those actions can be completely customized so they do not limit you in any way.<br/>
Claiming that signal/slot cannot deal with any instance existing just a brief amount of time is also wrong, since a QObject destructor automatically disconnects it from whatever it was listening to according to docs. And even if that wasn’t so, you can always disconnect() manually.</p>
<p>You are right that Qt is not MFC, but that should have been clear from looking at a few examples.<br/>
The only thing really bothersome about Qt I found to be that getting multithreading and signals/slots working together requires some extra effort, because for some weird reason, QObjects belong to a thread and depending on what you want to do, they will complain about being touched from a “wrong” thread.<br/>
Also, the Qt Designer is just… not very good.</p>

<p>May you explain what are your plans?<br/>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Sure can.</p>
<p>So, right now I’ve hacked around the command woes with a non-intuitive zero-interval repeating timer to trigger the commands to update (RegisteredAction class, derived from QAction) - it’s as close to a cross-platform WM_IDLE I could find. Most commands will be able to fit in with the added types that limit a command’s availability to a document type, type of selected datasource, state of a setting, etc. That’s really just an expansion of the existing DocumentRegisteredAction which up until now was only used for filtering in the “Quick Action” (CTRL+SPACEBAR) menu.</p>
<p>The localization stuff is going away for QT’s localization as <span class="hashtag">#1</span>) it doesn’t fit the switch-over to mostly IMGUI at all, <span class="hashtag">#2</span>) it didn’t actually work in tests … notifying every single LocalizedLabel that I switched to Esperanto reliably crashes QT during the resulting layout updates. It could probably work, but it’s not worth it. Safer to just stick with QT’s restart based localization, at the time I started it I didn’t know that you can’t change IME while QT is running - had I known that I wouldn’t have gone that road.</p>
<p>I’ve been investigating ImGizmo in a “base-code” fashion to simplify gizmo handling but ditching it’s IMGUI ties for different painting and input handling. I want to get to that sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>I need to investigate better handling of IMGUI popups. I suspect everything I need is there in the IMGUI context, but I haven’t checked it out yet. Worst case it’s just slapping an extra pointer on the ImWindow since I know all of the windows/sub-windows are there, so the problem is just knowing who belongs to who.</p>
<p>Priority is finishing the main Urho3D scene document and particle effect document. The particle-effect document has more “interesting” things to it than materials do so that’s a best case minimal document.</p>
<p>Lastly I’d like to expand more on top-level documentation explaining what is going on and why it is going on. In general I believe the code to be commented fairly well, with funky-stuff being noted and everything else as “should be obvious.” But the structural decisions and where things are, what they are, and why they are still isn’t clear. This is definitely getting better as the switch to IMGUI based widgets has resulted in removing many files, reducing both cognitive and exposure load.</p>
<p>These are the things I feel comfortable promising that I will do, even if I abandon ship, though I’m taking time to make sure that abandoning ship is the right choice for my other projects … CMake + modern-MFC doesn’t work (probably a cannot) at all so there’s that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What features do you miss in Qt?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More than anything I miss sane message dispatch. To arrive at something sane you have to attach each parent as an event filter to every single child … that’s just nasty.</p>
<p>The dock widget is also complete garbage. That may be my biggest issue with QT overall (aside from MOC basically breaking every 30 minutes). Their dock widgets aren’t even worthy of being called garbage. I’m looking at porting over some dock-widgets I wrote before MFC had official dock-widgets to it to ditch the non-sense.</p>
<p>Seems trite, but that widget has to form one of the main back-bones of a program. It cannot be as useless as QT’s version, it just can’t.</p>
<p>IME that isn’t fixed at startup would be nice … also known as “requried” since the first publication of IBM’s CUA.</p>

<p>As close to zero tight coupling as possible (signals/slots are tight coupling) and optimal reuse of all commands across documents … again without unnecessary coupling for the enabled/disabled/checked/unchecked/etc states.</p>
<p>I can only tolerate explicit coupling for so long.</p>

<p>I had a pretty solid idea walking into it what to expect and put a fair bit of time in screwing about with it first, but I greatly misjudged it. I had expected much closer to the usual WinForms/wxWidgets/WPF hack woes in practice.</p>
<p>If I had to slap a “biggest fault” on my considerations, it’d be that I never gave the “polish” stage a look, and that is the stage right now where everything is just plain awful beyond anything I have ever worked with before. Super duper awesome when slapping some things together, absolutely horrible when polishing it into behaving sanely.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I don’t use that … because it’s just as horrible as those nasty MFC, WinForms, wxWidgets, and WPF editors. They’re all awful, that’s not exclusive to QT, though QT designer is a cut above the most for awfulness (wxWidgets is so much worse).</p>

</aside>
<p>Provided you aren’t in the middle of a paint or relying on the status of any opaque QT object. There’s threading behind the scenes that will invalidate the hidden “d_ptr” and lead to awesome “invalid access 0x0000000000000018” errors and the like if you touch signals that in some way come back around to your QObject.</p>
<p>Was the whole reason for “PushDeferredCall” in the IMGUI stuff, so that those calls would go out through lambdas after paint was done so that their consequences wouldn’t nuke the d_ptr of the QPainter. There are plenty of other similar cases, if a signal somehow comes back to your class all bets are off regardless of your connection settings.</p>
<p>Edit: 0x0000000000000018 would be a call to QPainter::setClipRect on a QPainter whose d_ptr has been destroyed. Also the same generic error for setting text on a QLineEdit while it’s resizing.</p>
