<p>I and using UrhoSharp to crate a visualization of the Galaxy.  The Urho3D scene is rendering fine on an actual device, but when I use the iPhone simulator on an iMac, there are rendering uses where sections of nodes appear and disappear depending on the camera’s orientation.</p>
<p>Is this a known problem?  The compile/run turnaround time on a device is quite a bit longer than on the simulator so I’d like to use the simulator if possible.</p>
<p>If important, my iMac uses a Radeon Pro 560X 4 GB graphics chip.</p>

<p>You probably know the ios simulator and a real device are two completely different beasts. On a mac, the ios env is simulated. You’re really running on mac graphic card. That is only intended for simple testing on Apple sdk.<br/>
In short, do not expect it to work. Besides, UrhoSharp is abandonware…</p>

<p>Yes, I’m well aware that the simulator uses the Mac’s graphics card.  That is why I included its specs in my original post.  I have not seen any mention that Urho3D doesn’t work on Macs.  There are build scripts for the Mac so I would assume it is designed to work.</p>
<p>I could believe that Urho3D doesn’t work in the iOS simulator.  Is that a known issue?</p>
<p>It is distressing to hear you say the UrhoSharp is abandonware.  Microsoft’s Xamarin website is still promoting it as <em>the</em> way to do 3D graphics in Xamarin.  I’m basing a new, important project on UrhoSharp.</p>
<p>Why do you think the project has been abandoned?  What is one supposed to use for 3D graphics in Xamarin?</p>
<p>Edit:  OK, I did find this: <a href="https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/141631/urhosharp-is-dead-should-we-fork-it" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/141631/urhosharp-is-dead-should-we-fork-it</a><br/>
Would anyone care to comment?  I was hoping to create a cross-platform app (iOS, macOS, Android, UWP) that embedded a Urho3D view.  Is this not possible?</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/***/***" rel="nofollow noopener">***</a>. It’s a Urho3D fork with extensive C# support.</p>
<p>Their Github repository has a link to their Gitter. Maybe you could ask them if it supports what you need.</p>
