<p>While Bullet works fine for simple scenarios, but once more complex things are needed it performs poorly.</p>
<p>Bullet has a maddening trait which is collision margins:<br/>
Using 0 collision margin breaks raycasts and convexcasts, and possibly more things, so it isn’t really an option.<br/>
Collision margins create rounded corners. For example with character controllers it breaks combining maximum climb slope and auto stair stepping algorithms, because stairs are now round and have portion of steep slope.<br/>
It causes small unexpected bugs too. For example my monster AI code has ledge detection that first checks if the monster stands on the ground, and because of collision margins it always missed. I solved it my moving the raycast up by the collision margin length.<br/>
Also the roundness only apply to some of the shape-shape collision combinations (which is btw not documented and only explained in <a data-bbcode="true" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGAwRKPlpCw" rel="nofollow noopener">this video</a>).</p>
<p>Bullet also uses force based recovery from penetration, which can cause bad behaviors.<br/>
It may be the cause of bumping between convex hull floor segments, a body slightly penetrates the floor and bumps into the side of an adjacent floor body. (trimesh has edge connectivity utility that deals with that, but not convex hull)</p>
<p>I’ve observed small bodies getting pulling in between adjacent bodies like stairs, for example: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QVRYrcqrdE" rel="nofollow noopener">youtube.com/watch?v=2QVRYrcqrdE</a></p>
<p>Also, while trying to implement a character controller with advanced features (more than just pushing a rigid body), I’ve run into a lot of problems, and most of them led to catch-22’s with some broken feature in Bullet. for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using 0 margin to avoid round stairs breaks ray/convex casting.</li>
<li>Using setContactProcessingThreshold(0) to <a data-bbcode="true" href="http://www.bulletphysics.org/Bullet/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=10888" rel="nofollow noopener">avoid bumps between floor segments</a> causes unstable collision with walls.<br/>
I haven’t seen a single advanced character controller which works properly in Bullet (The sample one that comes with Bullet <a data-bbcode="true" href="http://www.bulletphysics.org/Bullet/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=10843" rel="nofollow noopener">doesn’t even handle recovery from penetration properly</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>I find Bullet unsuitable for games which have complex environments, or require an advanced character controller, and those are quite general cases.<br/>
I don’t know how Newton Dynamics compares to Bullet, but AFAIK it doesn’t use collision margins which is a huge advantage over Bullet, so maybe it could properly handle things Bullet can’t.</p>
<p>Did anyone use Newton Dynamics, especially recent versions? Are there any problems with it?<br/>
I also wonder if physics engine choice could be abstracted under Urho’s Physics API?<br/>
If not would it be similar like choosing between Lua and AngelScript?</p>

<p>That was the first thing I tried, it doesn’t fix it. Neither does changing the collision margin, or trying to use capsule instead of a cylinder.<br/>
This one isn’t even a catch-22 that you could try to do magic to bypass, you simply can’t do anything about it.<br/>
Anyway this is not a support thread.</p>
<p>The thread is about if there are other Physics engines that function properly where Bullet breaks.<br/>
Newton Dynamics seems like the best candidate for this role - It doesn’t use collision margins, it has ray &amp; convex cast, it’s actively developed, it’s documented.</p>

<p>Isn’t maintaining multiple physics engines going to be hell on Urho3D core developers?  I don’t recall seeing lots of manpower handling the various things needing to get done.  For the most part I’ve seen 2 people doing most of the work.  Although possibly I have a limited perspective on how Urho3D contributions flow and how they are maintained.  Anyways I’m generally aware that the more doo dads are added to an engine, the more maintenance effort is watered down.  I suppose I would ask, what is so broken about Bullet that it can’t be fixed?  I don’t have any experience with it really, I’m just asking.  And, why can’t it be fixed upstream of Urho3D?</p>

<p>The fun thing about Urho3D’s use of systems is that you can bring in another physics engine without having to do anything with the original physics engine. It’s just a set of components. Just create the components that controls Newton’s system instead and refrain from using the Bullet components. Boom, integrated.</p>
<p>On that note, I have a basic Newton implementation already in place for libblu. So far only boxes, but I only spent a few hours on it.</p>

<p>bvanevery is quite spot on regarding the core developer manpower. It would be no problem to integrate Newton as an option (I will not make comments on its quality since I’ve not tested it personally in depth) if we got a contributor who does the integration and is then willing to maintain it. In general Urho3D’s problem is accumulating features while former steady contributors become inactive, leaving for the most part me and Yao Wei Tjong to maintain the whole.</p>

<p>One thing I’ve noticed on Newton is that it doesn’t support MinGW. For example, it looks for <code>_MSC_VER</code> instead of <code>_WIN32</code> to identify windows platform in macros. Includes a little non-standard(?) code as well. For example, uses members of types with constructors in anonymous structs/aggregates.</p>
<p>Example of win32 detection: <a href="https://github.com/MADEAPPS/newton-dynamics/blob/master/sdk/dgCore/dgTypes.cpp#L32" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/MADEAPPS/newton-dynamics/blob/master/sdk/dgCore/dgTypes.cpp#L32</a></p>

<p>While these are minor and can be fixed with a quick find and replace. It makes me believe that the library never even considered MinGW as a potential compiler. So there may further issues. (<em>actually there are a few more</em>)</p>
<p>The build system(s?) is pretty broken. Especially for Windows. But then again, that’s true for most other physics engine library out there.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the physics engine seems neat.</p>

<p>It’s nice to have another option besides Bullet, however I would have preferred nVidia PhysX. It seems to be the engine of choice for all major commercial engines (Unreal, Unity, CryEngine/Lumberyard, etc). Also it has a couple of game specific features that I like: world center shifting (useful for large worlds) and setting a scaling factor when initializing the engine (so you are not stuck to the 5cm-10m range of Bullet).</p>

<p>What is the status of the Newton Dynamics integration? Is it production ready yet (or at least at in testable state)?</p>
<p>After spending months building a world at realistic scale, I’m getting sick and tired of Bullet letting objects fall through the floor and other objects hovering above the ground, etc. I’d really like to try another physics engine in the near future.</p>

<p>Newton also relies on a constant update rate (which Urho should have but doesn’t)  It still works without it but is much more stable if you use my branch: <a href="https://github.com/TrevorCash/Urho3D/tree/enginetimingchanges2" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/TrevorCash/Urho3D/tree/enginetimingchanges2</a><br/>

<p>Newton is certainly more accurate than Bullet, but it costs something for that accuracy - what is your use-case that requires such accuracy, and how does it apply to a game engine? Oh - and did you try Bullet with double enabled? real8 is a lot more accurate than real4 floating point</p>

<p>In my tests I’ve found newton to be on par with bullet as far as performance is concerned.  I use this integration because of the rigidity and accuracy of the simulation.  Constraints are rock solid and don’t suffer from joint wobble near as much as Bullet per the same iteration count/cpu cycles.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@TrevorCash</span> for real solid joints you shouldn’t have simulated joints at all, but a single rigid body with the colliders (aka compound). Is there anything preventing you from doing that in your use case?<br/>
Edit: I just realized you might be talking about joints other than fixed, like for example hinge joints… you have to sim those ofc</p>

<p>Hi Alan,  Yes of course, if you have 2 bodies with no degrees of freedom its best to make a compound.  Its pretty easy with the API just add multiple CollisionShape components and 1 RigidBody component to a node.  The RigidBody will use all attached CollisionShapes and form a compound internally.</p>
<p>If you look at the motorcycle video - the midframe of the bike is a compound formed this way.</p>
<p>with regards to joints - yes I am talking about well, the joints <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/33cb8d9bf277cdb113680cf5564b6764.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>

<p>My biggest problem with Bullet is the size limit of the dynamic objects:<br/>
<em>“The minimum object size for moving objects is about 0.2 units, 20 centimeters for Earth gravity.”</em> quote from Bullet’s manual. And also the largest size is about 5 or 7 meters (from what I remember).</p>
<p>So if you want to do a survival game and you want to have a box of matches which is 5 x 2 x 1 cm, you can’t do it with Bullet, as it’s too small and the object will fall through (the terrain or other objects) when you drop it. So, I tried scaling up the whole world to try and make the smallest object large enough, but then if you want to have vehicles, than you exceed the upper size limit and also if your terrain is too large, you start loosing float range accuracy (going to double would most likely affect performance). I could also try increasing the simulation rate, but then again you are reducing the performance of the game.</p>
<p>I’m hoping Newton can handle a wide range of sizes for dynamic objects (I’m yet to find out).</p>

<p>Bullet Dynamics works best with objects whose size ranges from a tennis ball, to a bus.<br/>
Outside of these limits, the numbers get too big or too small for the default 32 bit math.<br/>
You can switch your build settings for Bullet to use 64 bit math (double floats) and this gives you a much richer experience, with generally the same performance as 32 bit, just a greater numerical range to work with. I don’t know if Newton has some magical way to deal with numerical precision, but I suspect it uses 64 bits by default, where the platform can support it.</p>
<p>[EDIT]<br/>
Oh, and the limits mainly apply to dynamic objects. Static objects can be enormous, Kinematic objects suffer tunneling issues at your discretion, and CCD helps a lot with tunneling on dynamic objects at high velocities, even on 32 bit precision. I would say that Newton and Bullet are similar in performance, except where it comes to things like impulse chains, where Bullet offers things like featherstone solver, but Newton uses classical iterative methods in its resolvers.</p>

<p>I’ve hit limits recently with single precision in Urho3D - not in Bullet per se, but in the Node class, which underpins character bone animation. I’m trying to measure delta-transforms on the character hips and apply the delta-translations to the character’s true root node. Numerical precision is terrible when I use inverse transforms on a scaled model. The order of error is large. Note I zeroed the Y value in this computation, but here I compare my output numbers to my expectations. The scale of the error is often approaching 10.</p>

<p>Hi Lieth,</p>
<p>Generally I have found ( and I’m sure you know) that avoiding node scale as much as possible always helps.  Usually in your hierarchy for the ragdoll if you enforce that all nodes should have (1,1,1) scale and then have child nodes that do have scale for visual stuff. then you can do the math on the root nodes without worrying about the scaling side effects.</p>
