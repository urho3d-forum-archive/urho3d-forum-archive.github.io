<p>I’m trying to make a really basic platformer. So far, I can make the player character move just fine using RigidBody and ApplyImpulse, and I can also make camera orbit around the player. However, I’m struggling with making the character’s movement follow the angle of the camera. I want to move in the direction of the camera by pressing forward (W), move in a direction 90° to the right of wherever the camera’s pointing when I press right (D), move directly towards the camera by pressing back (S) and so on.</p>
<p>For reference, <a href="https://pastebin.com/xqUvQzcp" rel="nofollow noopener">here’s a pastebin with all the code I have so far</a>.</p>
<p>Sorry if this is too obvious of a thing to ask about - as you may be able to tell from my code, I’m an absolute beginner <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/94dd27e9c6c243335d29229e02e34e9d.png" title=":smiley:"/></p>

<p>Instead of moving along the fixed world axes you should take the rotation of the camera node into account.</p>
<p>Check out example 18 (Character Demo), if I have understood you correctly it should do exactly what you want to achieve (except maybe locking the character to the camera. But that shouldn’t be hard to change).</p>

<p>The movement code I’m using comes from the Character Demo, actually! So it’s not quite what I want, as it still moves the RigidBody relative to the <em>character</em>’s direction as opposed to the <em>camera</em>’s. (the Character Demo forces the character to always face in the direction of the camera, but I want to avoid doing that)</p>

<p>Would using <code>cameraNode-&gt;GetWorldDirection()</code> and such as the direction of your impulse give you what you want?</p>

<p>After ramming my head against the wall for a while, I finally managed to come up with something. <a href="https://pastebin.com/dxaNYx1Q" rel="nofollow noopener">You can check it out here</a> (this pastebin only includes the changed parts). It’s a very <em>caveman</em> solution that may have to be completely rewritten whenever I get around to analog controller support but hey, for now it works and that’s what matters.</p>
