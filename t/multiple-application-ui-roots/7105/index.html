<p>We’re devising a Game Editor setup using Avalonia, with elix22’s <a href="http://Urho.NET" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Urho.NET</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s the general scheme:</p>
<ol>
<li>Urho App is the main app, and owns the Main Window.</li>
<li>In Game Editor mode, we’re using Urho’s UI system to render a full-screen sprite inside which Avalonia is rendering.</li>
<li>Inside of Avalonia’s Dock Control sample, we have an Urho View 3D, which renders great.</li>
<li>ISSUE:  Since our Game UI is ALSO going to use Avalonia, we need for it to render inside the View3D game window.</li>
</ol>
<p>But View3D doesn’t sport it’s own Urho UI.   We’d like a 2nd instance of Urho UI to place inside the View3D, and have it work the same as it does for the full screen now.</p>
<p>Perhaps I’m missing something; another/better way.</p>
<p>For now – we have a work-around which is to simply use the SAME Urho.UI.Root to create the Sprite (which renders Avalonia), and place that Sprite overtop the View3D window, so that it appears to be a part of the View3D.</p>
<p>This seems to work fine, and performs well-enough - but the solution feels kludgy.   I think we’d prefer to have a separate UI.Root that runs inside the View3D itself.   (A UI inside the UI.)</p>
<p>Another idea that just popped into my head now is that maybe we can Parent the Game UI sprite to the View3D – and maybe that resolves it, if there is relative-sizing/positioning – so that if View3D resizes or moves – the child Sprite inside it will move/resize in unison.   (OR… we can just manually do this math, and create the same effect in C#).</p>
<p>Here’s a screenshot of our KLUDGE – the UI sample we’re using here is crap – it’s just a placeholder.   We have already figured out how to make this semi-transparent with click-through-to-scene.</p>

<p>I’ve not tried it myself, but what happens if you just create another UI? You won’t be able to make it a Subsystem in the Context, since there can only be one per type, but it might work.</p>
<p>Alternatively, could you just use the View3D or a UI element with the same size as it where you would otherwise use UI::GetRoot()?</p>

<p>We’ve resolved to making it work with just one UI.Root, as you have suggested.   We’ll just do our own math (for position offsets/scale) and wrapper to make it <em>seem</em> like multiple independent UI systems.</p>
<p>This works just fine.  Feels like a kludge to us, but won’t to our users, who will be able to treat this like two independent UI’s – Game Design Tools vs. the In-Game UI.</p>
<p>From Urho perspective, we simply map an Avalonia Window to an Urho.UI.Sprite, and it works efficiently and without issue (that we can see now).</p>
