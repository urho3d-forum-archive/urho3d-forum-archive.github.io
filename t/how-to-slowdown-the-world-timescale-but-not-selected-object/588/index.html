<p>I’m trying to figure out how to slowdown the whole world(scene).<br/>
but I do not need same thing slowless for my object.</p>
<p>I make that world is now more slowdown by Scene.SetTimeScale(),</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	if (input-&gt;GetKeyDown(KEY_P)) 
	{
		if (!isTimeScaled) 
		{
			GetNode()-&gt;GetScene()-&gt;SetTimeScale(0.1f);
			isTimeScaled = true;
		}
	}</code></pre>
<p>but how to make a normal speed for my one selected node(object)?<br/>
I thought to increase the SetTimeScale in the same number of times that I reduced the speed of the world.<br/>
but the object was not his own SetTimeScale()</p>

<p>Hi codingmonkey,</p>
<p>Forgive me about stating the obvious, but wouldn’t you just set the timescale to 0.1 and just multiply the speed of everything related to that object to *10.0? Timescale would be global so it would affect that object unless you artificially just boost the object’s timescale-related attributes. Unless you are requesting that each object has an override to the timescale?</p>

<p>I think that you can do without it. ?nly settings(multiply) timescale of selected object w/o change speed of objects, besides objects consist from more complecs components and change (multiply speed) all of them: animation mesh, animation materials, amin shaders, rigid body speeds, time based logic…ect - this is hard way, you know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unless you are requesting that each object has an override to the timescale?<br/>
if I understood you correctly. I just want it and that each object has changed it’s own timescale for affecting to it’s own and their children, and components.</p>
