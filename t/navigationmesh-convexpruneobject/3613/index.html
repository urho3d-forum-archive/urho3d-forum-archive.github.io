<p>Just for show.</p>
<p>I finally got around to using NavigationMesh on the project that I’m working on, and for the most part, functionalities that I need are there.  However, I added a few enhancements.</p>
<p>First enhancement was adding a ConvexPruneObject class which as the name suggests prunes nav tiles as untraversable, as shown by the magenta tiles shown in fig 1 and fig 2. This came about after observing that creating a huge Obstacles lacked features that I needed. Querying for nearest path inside an obstacle (position of the white box shown in fig 2) returned a tile inside the obstacle.  By pruning the unwanted tiles, the nearest position is acquired outside the convex object.</p>
<p>Second enhancement was loading nav tiles from file and load them in a single contiguous memory instead of building the nav mesh at load time.  In my simple scene, it takes about 1.4 seconds to build the navmesh and it takes less than 1 msec. to load tiles from file and rebuild it.</p>
<p>Third simple enhancement - for navmesh to ignore nodes with “ignore” tag used for thing as trigger boxes, small debris, and far off mountains that’ll never get traversed.</p>

<p>For anyone new to DynamicNavigationMesh, let me clarify that creating a huge Obstacle was just a test and should not be created for your game levels.  Obstacles should be small and are meant to be dynamic, which can potentially be removed at runtime.</p>
