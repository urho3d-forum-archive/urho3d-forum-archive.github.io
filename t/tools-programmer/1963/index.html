<p>Hey,<br/>
Is this paid?<br/>
Any restrictions apply? For example would programmer be allowed to use this work in his own projects?<br/>
Any plans to opensource these later on?</p>
<p>Because i am sort of working on the same thing for myself. I would not mind teaming up with someone if we find common ground on various things. But i do not think you could count on me as person who would take care of that list alone. I do not want to get paid, i dont mind opensourcing my code, all i want is good tools to use. Currently for my editor im using imgui which iFire pointed me to. Idea is same like yours - so editor can be used in-game. It works pretty sweet. Due to immediate mode of gui any changes to scene from anywhere (be it game code or editor) are immediately reflected in GUI. Im not moving forward as fast as i wanted though, so i suppose working with few other people with a same goal could be beneficial to all of us. What are your thoughts?</p>

<p>Currently this is unpaid, could change if we one day get some kind of income for the engine.<br/>
No restrictions, you would be able to implement it into your own project as long as there are ways to identify each separately (dont want people confused between them)<br/>
Open source is not something we have talked about yet as we are far from a releasable product but the current state of the engine industry says it likely will.</p>
