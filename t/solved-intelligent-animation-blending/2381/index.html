<p>Hi, all!</p>
<p>I need help with my animations.</p>
<p>I have “idle” animation, “walk” animation and “breathe” animation.</p>
<p>I need to blend “breathe” into first and second. All animations are exported with translations and rotations<br/>
by exporter.<br/>
As I see, it is not possible to blend cleanly, as it produce weird effect (as it uses full bone poses, i.e.<br/>
if body is rotated towards front by walk it will be straightened by breathe.<br/>
I had high hopes for Urho layered animation for this as I don’t want to produce thousands of animations per character in Blender.<br/>
I can recombine them in Blender but it looks so 1990s. What is intended workflow?</p>
<p>Also how can I remove unneeded channels for blended-in animations like “breathe”? I just need rotations there.<br/>
I don’t want to remove all channels by hand…</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, is it possible to use additive animation, i.e. translations are added to animations, rotations multiplied?</li>
</ul>

<p>By default there’s no support for additive animations , but you can write your own in no time.I wrote my own for bullet hit “twitching” and weapon aim offset.</p>

<p>Blending a “breathe” animation with the other two would be tough, indeed, due to the use of spine joints.  Urho3D does has layered animation where you can layer a secondary anim to the main.  An example would be layering Mutant_Wave_LY.anim on w/e primary anim.  If I were to attempt to layer a “breathe” anim, I’d key only the upper two spines and make the movement more prominent.</p>

<p>well, blending mode of ABM_ADDITIVE actually works great, so I don’t need to do complicated things.</p>

<p>Would you be kind enough to share some code, or even better, the research material you have used to write your implementation?</p>
