<p>UMDL2 Proposal</p>
<p>These are my notes (portions are complete but still), please rip them to pieces.</p>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>Addition of <code>ResponseCurve</code> type
<ul>
<li>Functional curves defined by standard MKCB, shape, inverse-X, and inverse-Y</li>
<li>Will be part of variant</li>
<li>Aside from animation they’re useful for AI weight functions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Addition of key -&gt; key interpolation parameters
<ul>
<li>Defined by response curves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Addition of track blend parameters
<ul>
<li>Defined by response curves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Addition of MorphTracks
<ul>
<li>Recorded morph-target weights in animation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Addition of <code>Phases</code>
<ul>
<li>Similar to triggers but windows of time</li>
<li>Each phase has a name, start, end, and arbitrary Variants associated with start/end</li>
<li>Blends can specify phases to synchronize against
<ul>
<li>see <strong>DOOM</strong> talk for retargeting</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Root-motion as a first class citizen
<ul>
<li>Tied as well into phases</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Weighted push model for animation
<ul>
<li>Existing animation works as is superficially
<ul>
<li>new work can push over it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Facilitates pushing keys on demand rather than relying on existing animation
<ul>
<li>Futures are pushed, final blend reads the resulting futures for the given time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Provides correction that doesn’t require sorting post-update bone correcting components</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Additional stock components for
<ul>
<li>Terrestrial navigation selection</li>
<li>Saccades and blink</li>
<li>IK assistance for strings of Look-at (see <strong>DOOM</strong> talk)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>The biggest missing thing is selection-sets IMO, but those are not trivially reconcilable IMO.</p>

<ul>
<li>Morph-tracks
<ul>
<li>Basically finished</li>
<li>Supported in the binary UMDL2 format and in the XML files already used for triggers, allowing their presence in the XML files
<ul>
<li>Assimp pretty is morph-idiotic, sxs XML support there provides a supplementary tool path lighter export from DCC tool</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Phases
<ul>
<li>Down to testing stage and verifying that the matching functions work as intended
<ul>
<li>for <em>naive</em> match to normalized position, not going to bother trying to do weighted sync in Urho3D’s animation, it’s all way off in the wrong direction for that - a silly amount of work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Phases can function as <em>loop portions</em> for looping animations, only exiting the phase when the animation is fading out</li>
<li>Also supported in either binary UMDL2 output or the sxs XML</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Root-motion
<ul>
<li>Not actually that serious, there’s just no existing reasonable utility means to query the necessary information one actually wants to do root-motion from Animation resources
<ul>
<li>ie. grab the animation root transforms for the start and end of airborne phase, then retarget the root-motion on the fly to an arbitrary traversal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dealing with the above is better than going for one-fix-for-all</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Weighted-push model
<ul>
<li>Not necessary</li>
<li>Just need to be able to push arbitrary <code>AnimationState</code> instances into an <code>AnimationController</code> and replicate those over network
<ul>
<li>ie. target-by-name transforms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<code>Animation</code> resource is also a bit <em>too</em> fixed, it’s a jerk to work with and should be refined to be easier to work with and even use perpetually appended one-off <em>managed</em> resources
<ul>
<li>hence, focus on <code>AnimationState</code> instead - resources are network dumb</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>Fairly sure it doesn’t actually belong in master, but just dropped elsewhere for utility. <strong>DOOM</strong> navigation wheel is largely functional now, only some dead-zone tuning to go and determining whether it should be controlling animation directly or signaling-events (right now it directly controls, which gets wonky with the dead-zone counter-rotation).</p>

<p>Did you end up finishing this? I don’t really have any comments as I don’t have enough experience with animation to provide feedback, but I’m about to start the work of animating models for my game and some of these features seem very useful.</p>
