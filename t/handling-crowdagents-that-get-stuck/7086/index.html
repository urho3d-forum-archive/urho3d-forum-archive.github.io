<p>So I have some crowd agents that get stuck sometimes. For example if I jump down a ledge the agents have a path leading up to the ledge and the ground below it. However if I have multiple agents that stand by the ledge that I jumped off of. One of the agents sometimes falls to the ground below. This agent will not move anymore even though he is on the navigation mesh still.</p>
<p>Just seeking some suggestions on a solution. Maybe re-spawning agents that are stuck? I tried periodically checking the agents velocity to see if he was moving still, and if not re-spawn the agent. This did not work very well though.</p>

<p>So I have made some changes to my crowd navigation. I discovered that my player class was always setting the players position for the crowd agents to often. I set this propagation to have a delay, and not update every loop of the game. This seems to make a big improvement.</p>
<p>More changes coming.</p>
