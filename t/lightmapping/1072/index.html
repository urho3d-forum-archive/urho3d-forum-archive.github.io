<p>Great update Sinoid! One thing to note though and I assume you already considered blending dynamic shadows and the lightmaps for this tool?.. but I’m sure you already anticipated this one.  <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/95940790c23d98635b2a6d3f22657158.png" title=":wink:"/></p>
<p>Maybe something simple like “Bake Scene”, with texture size for the lightmaps as options, etc in GUI, and a switch option between real-time and baked lights.</p>
<p>This is really awesome work, can’t wait to try it out…</p>

<p>Whoa, really impressive!</p>
<p>Two things I don’t like about baked lighting:</p>
<ol>
<li>Baking in 3d editor is pain. It takes time, and a lots of repetitive actions, you make it each time you want to move a tiny thing or made a mistake. So, having a one button in-editor baking is super cool.</li>
<li>There always a challenge of getting static and dynamic geometry look similar. And that’s the thing you just can do perfect. They will always be a bit different.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, how do you see shading on dynamic models? Dynamic lights + cubemap set by zone? What about situation, when some large object casting a shadow, and dynamic model can move into it? Have you considered adding a light probes?</p>

<p>After having thought about this more. Light probes are going to live in the Zone, most likely as subdivisions/voxels of spherical harmonics ambient cubes so that zones don’t have to be tiny and all over the place. Mobile could then choose the resolution it wants to use and the existing Zone properties still function on top of that (ie. Zone color biases the ambient cubes, etc). Cube maps are a different beast.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Seems reasonable. There can be only one reflection cubemap per zone, and a bunch of light probes affecting diffuse.</p>
<p>Ability to edit each probe’s position can be essential. In cases like placing them on terrain surface, or making sure no probe placed inside geometry. Navmesh can be a good reference for lightprobe placing.</p>

<p>Again awesome work ! I am big fan of spherical-harmonics. Are you working on anything to convert HDR images to SH coefficients ? Is there any bands limitation in the current workflow ?  I guess 8 bands would be the maximum for games.<br/>
Do you have any plans for tracing shadows from the spherical harmonics, although this might be expensive.</p>

<p>I had some errors generating mipmaps.  I fell back to letting opengl making the mipmaps for me.  Texture array extension support is very good on opengl2.  There is also some issue with cubemaps and the deserializer.  Cubemap is hardcoded to xml filetype.  So a tag should be made and read from for arrays/cubemaps and a serializer/deserializer needs to be added to my code too.</p>

<p>There’s some cleanup and documentation required before it’s even PR worthy.</p>
<p>The handling of the lightmaps runtime side is also quite questionable and probably full of exceptional failure cases. I’ve been meaning to look at allowing Resources to spoof as being other resources (or at least indicate who the REAL resource is). The hassle is that from a usability standpoint, lightmapping has to be reasonably non-intrusive … it is unacceptable for lightmapping to interfere with the materials that have been defined.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on some hybrid CPU/GPU GI stuff. It’s going quite well, but no where near primetime. Hilariously, I’ve been enhancing my knowledge of Geometric Algebra to find better solutions, which happens to be exactly what Enlighten uses (only became aware of that after I started diving down that round for reprojection of point clouds, now it’s a patent dancing nightmare).</p>
<p>I want to point out, that at all times, screenspace GI should be an option if you’re doing GI at all. If you’re going to do SSAO, there’s no reason not to do SSDO on top of anything else.[/quote]</p>
<p>I see tests of the SSGI in UE4 and give problems is like the SSR but the reflections you notice less than the light, if you add sometype of dynamic GI you got in UE4 the LPV in alpha/beta status as reference but that LPV or something like that should be better than SSGI.<br/>
*Tested in demo scenes probably in a final result game looks better without problems idk.</p>

<p>Very cool work Sinoid!</p>
<p>Have you looked at blender’s cycles? That renderer can be decoupled from blender as standalone with an Apache 2.0 license and can do bake maps. I think it needs some basic patches though to make standalone take in meshes and use the bake functions instead of the regular render functions, very doable though. Even the XML API it has out of the box could be ‘hacked’ to just take in Urho3D’s scenegraph format and leverage Urho’s shadow mesh buffers (as in, the CPU-side buffers) which go directly into cycles’ BVH conversion (bypassing its mesh class), hell I was thinking about taking your lightmap integration code and making it pass into cycles as an idea. Sure shaders need converting to cycles-style, but if you’re following PBR principles and texture authoring this is trivial to support, for the surfaces and light emissions you want to replicate.</p>
<p>That is, if it’s worth doing now as you’ve already got a nice working implementation here… I’m not too familiar what kinds of light map data you want though which work with normal maps and such in the shader at runtime, but I think you’re already covering this, Sinoid?</p>

<p>So far Houdini was not very good doing Lightmapping as texture baking was only supported in micropolygon renderer mode. But know with Houdini 15 it works with PBR as well, but I think there might be still some bleeding edge issues.<br/>
Doing a lightmapper using Urho3d API is more open and I think it is quite useful for procedural games. Where Houdini API is completely closed source.</p>

<p>[quote=“Sinoid”][quote]I see tests of the SSGI in UE4 and give problems is like the SSR but the reflections you notice less than the light, if you add sometype of dynamic GI you got in UE4 the LPV in alpha/beta status as reference but that LPV or something like that should be better than SSGI.<br/>
*Tested in demo scenes probably in a final result game looks better without problems idk.[/quote]</p>
<p>Do you have a link to SSGI regarding UE4? I’m only aware of the LPV and SVOGI attempts. I would never expect screen space to be an adequate replacement, just an adequate “fill” to augment existing lightmapping or other GI approaches (ie. to mask the dynamic objects problem in a realtime lightmapping approach).<br/>

<p>Well the SVOGI is dropped before the UE4 release, and the LPV are in development by a third party company creating a game with that. The only Voxel based solution now is the Nvidia one you have that in the Nvidia fork i think.<br/>
About the SSGI Epic is testing and developing different solutions to get a realtime GI solution because now UE4 don’t have nothing the LPV is in alpha and is by another company and the Nvidia solution is not added, that is because they are testign with different solutions, If i found the post i send to you the link.</p>
<p>Not sure but i think I see that in a preview version of the DFGI <a href="https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?68006-Guide-to-Global-Illumination" rel="nofollow noopener">forums.unrealengine.com/showthr … lumination</a></p>
