<p>I have a bit of a problem involving physics collision detection.</p>
<p>The player character is holding a weapon, which is attached to their right hand.<br/>
The zombie character has an animated ragdoll armature of rigidbodies.</p>
<p>When player character attacks zombie with weapon, and when weapon collides with zombie bodypart, I am notified of the collision: which bodies took part, and the parent nodes of those two rigidbodies.</p>
<p>Now I know that a weapon has struck a specific bodypart on a zombie.<br/>
But I don’t know which player was wielding that weapon, or which zombie was struck!</p>
<p>The node information I am provided is too deep in the scene hierarchies of these two characters to tell which characters were involved!</p>
<p>String tags seem like a bad choice to identify parentage, and the Bullet Physics userpointers are already being used by Urho3D.</p>
<p>Urho3D’s RigidBody and Node classes do not support user pointers which I could set to identify my owner object.</p>
<p>Is there any recommendations about how to tag Urho3D objects as being related to some other object, particularly with regards to rapidly identifying the root grandparent of a deeply nested child?</p>

<p>Maybe you could set up a variant for a node and store the body parts. Even better idea is to send your own events. That’s how i did it.</p>

<p>Thanks for the input, Dave82!</p>
<p>It looks like I can use Node::SetVar to set a named Variant, which can hold either a naked pointer (void*) or more safely, a RefCounted pointer.<br/>
String Tags really are a horrible idea, but the Node class does have support for multiple named and typed user variables, including pointers, so I consider this case solved. Your mention of “variant on a node” is what reminded me to look into exactly what I can do with node variables. Cheers!</p>
