<p>Hi, I’m currently messing around with Urho3d. It’s a cool library with some nice features, first impressions are good. The intrusive ref counting for Urho’s pointers is a bit iffy, but i’ve let it slide <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/33cb8d9bf277cdb113680cf5564b6764.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>
<p>So I’ve been messing around, built some objects and effects, and I have encountered an issue where my ParticleEmitter’s ScenePostUpdate subscription isn’t being found.</p>
<p>Some context…</p>
<p>Firstly, I was building a basic ‘game’ using a class ‘Game’ deriving from Urho3D::Application.<br/>
My scene, camera, everything was owned by Game. I built a ParticleEmitter, added it to a node which was a child of the scene and everything worked fine. I had a lovely torch like effect in my game!</p>
<p>After some time I found that I was going to want multiple scenes, and was going to have them all inside the Game::Start() function which is called by the Engine. This wasn’t what I wanted, I want all scenes in a separate class so they can be switched between easily, whilst keeping my project clean.</p>
<p>My solution to this was to create a new class ‘World’ deriving from Urho3D::Object.<br/>
I structured this class virtually the same as how ‘Game’ was structured. It had a World::Start() function which was called inside Game::Start() which initialises all the same things that Game::Start() used to ( scene, camera, boxes, particleEmitter). However, now the event subscriptions were being setup through scene_-&gt;SubscribeToEvent() rather than just SubscribeToEvent(). ( This had something to do with ‘Game’ using the member function of its derived class ‘Object’ while my new class ‘World’ wouldn’t let me do that.)</p>
<p>The end result of this transition was the paticleEmitter not showing on my screen. That was the only thing that had broken. I have tired a lot of different things to fix this with no result.</p>
<p>After some debugging I think I tracked the bug down to the ParticleEmitter’s subscription not being called correctly (ScenePostUpdate) OR the subscription itself isn’t being setup correctly.</p>
<p>Any advice/help would be very helpful. Also, if anyone has any solutions to the issue of how to store scenes so they can be activated like modules that would be great.</p>
<p>EDIT: It wasn’t Context::SubscribeToEvent it was Scene::SubscribeToEvent</p>

<p>I cannot find this <code>Context::SubscribeToEvent</code> method and your <code>World</code> class <em>should</em> inherit it. That’s probably where you should look.</p>
<p>Also, welcome to the forums! <img alt=":confetti_ball:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/2e7550946e098183e5e0689c128eb557.png" title=":confetti_ball:"/> <img alt=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/c5efadebdea06e0499f03c0a7e1e9e61.png" title=":slightly_smiling_face:"/></p>

<p>Unfortunately I don’t see anything wrong with your code.<br/>
Do you get any error messages during run time? Are you sure the emitter is in view?</p>

<p>No errors, and it should be in view. I created a box on the same node and it was at the correct coords.</p>
<p>It is a super weird bug, otherwise I would have been able to work it out myself <img alt=":confused:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/248c3403bd293447e7e0858e608b88e8.png" title=":confused:"/></p>

<p>Could you try leaving out <code>World</code>'s private <code>context_</code>? It already inherits this from <code>Object</code> to which it is passed through the constructor.</p>

<p>Hi Modanung,</p>
<p>I just tried what you asked, removed storing a shared pointer to context in my World and instead used the Objects context, this had no effect on my program.</p>
