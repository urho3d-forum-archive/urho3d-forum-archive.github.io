<p>Hi guys,<br/>
I tried AGK2 and CopperCube but both can’t handle projected shadows and for me a 3D game MUST have projected shadows.<br/>
So I found Urho3D today and I really impressed by some demos; wow!</p>
<p>I have some basic questions :</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is There an IDE (like dark basic / AGK) or there is an interface like CopperCube ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can I get dynamic projected shadows?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where is the command list?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can I use Urho3D from my PC windows10 to program a game for android (apk)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can I use heightmaps?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how I can start to program something? I get a folder with a lot of cmake files… what is that?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<li>Not really. There are some AngelScript IDEs out there, naturally there are a lot of things that support Lua, and C++ has Visual Studio, Eclipse CDT, Codeblocks, etc. But there isn’t really anything specific to Urho besides the Editor, which is mostly just for scene construction. The Editor is, I suppose, kind of like CopperCube, but programming is a heavy focus of Urho (e.g. I almost never use the editor except to view the scene heirarchy of a saved scene from my game), while CopperCube from the brief look I gave it seems to hide that from the user.</li>
<li>Assuming I know what you mean, yes. Like what’s in sample 18?</li>
<li>Not sure what you mean. API is here: <a data-bbcode="true" href="http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/</a>
</li>
<li>You should be able to. I’m pretty sure I got it working before, but I’ve switched to just working in Linux, which I find to be much more programmer friendly.</li>
<li>Yes, though I don’t know if support is official yet (it looks like it is): <a data-bbcode="true" href="http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.5/class_urho3_d_1_1_terrain.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.5/class_urho3_d_1_1_terrain.html</a> (Also, Google “urho3d heightmaps” for some additional information</li>
<li>Build the library (that’s what all the cmake scripts are for). There are directions for that in another link in the documentation, but if you’ve done that, then you want <a data-bbcode="true" href="http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.5/_using_library.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.5/_using_library.html</a>.<br/>
6b) Alternatively, you could use Lua/AngelScript for your whole game (I would not advise that), but in that case you would just run it from the Urho3DPlayer.</li>

<p>wow seems I am in a very different world than DarkBasicPRO/AGK world!</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Sir</span> Nate:<br/>
Thank you so mutch for your answers, at least I realized that I was understanding NOTHING about Urho3D.<br/>
There are a lot of conceptual differences… too time programming with a single IDE and now I need to face lula, angels and a lot of new things to handle.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@codingmonkey</span>:<br/>
Thank you for the example!</p>
<p>I avoid to shot another questions before to take a good look to the tutorials!<br/>
For now THANK YOU guys! (and sorry for my weird english…)</p>

<p>If you used procedural languages before (DBpro ,  AGK , etc) I highly recommend to learn c++ and Object orinted programming first before you start with Urho3d. There are lots of stuff that are really hard to learn if you don’t have a strong fundamental knowledge of  OOP , C++ and CMake. I’m not talking about buying expensive books with 864246512 pages but running through some basic c++ tutorials wouldn’t hurt.</p>

<p>Practice a lot ! Build some pointless apps using the STL (Nothing fancy , just some basic sorting , simple text andveture games using the console, etc).<br/>
Study the structure of other libraries , and try to understand the core of OOP.</p>
<p>As for CMake : Urho3d builds beautifully without any additonal fiddling and error tracing in make files , so just use the CMake GUI (the method condingmonkey posted ) it should work out of box.If you using windows , it’s even easier to just<br/>
1 build urho3d using CMake GUI<br/>
2. Setup include paths , library paths in Visual Studio ( Something like Urho3D/Include and Urho3D/lib/) and thats it.<br/>
3. include Urho3d.h in you project and start coding.<br/>
4. Additionally include the required headers for your need (eg Urho3D/Physics/RigidBody.h or Urho3D/Audio/Sound.h , etc)</p>
