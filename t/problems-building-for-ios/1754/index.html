<p>I cannot get my game built for iOS.<br/>
I managed to build Urho3D for iOS, but when I try to build my game it complains when linking to Urho3D.</p>
<p>The error message I get in Xcode is:<br/>
ld: warning: -headerpad_max_install_names is ignored when used with -bitcode_bundle (Xcode setting ENABLE_BITCODE=YES)<br/>
ld: warning: ignoring file /Users/esa/Urho3D-master-20150706/Urho3D-master/BuildIOS/lib/libUrho3D.a, file was built for archive which is not the architecture being linked (arm64): /Users/esa/Urho3D-master-20150706/Urho3D-master/BuildIOS/lib/libUrho3D.a<br/>
ld: entry point (_main) undefined. for architecture arm64</p>
<p>I’m not sure which architecture Xcode is building for, especially since only one lib-file is built…<br/>
In the Xcode project it says that the these architectures are supported: arm64, armv7, armv7s<br/>
I tried to just change to arm64 but without any luck.</p>
<p>When running cmake I have tried with and without -DURHO3D_64BIT=1<br/>
I can build for OS X without any problems.<br/>
Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br/>
I forgot to mention that I just get the build problem when trying to run om my hooked up iPad mini. On the simulator it works.<br/>
I just tested another thing now:<br/>
Select my device in Xcode + change build setting that it should just build for the active architecture.<br/>
I did this both when building Urho3D and my game, and it worked!  <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/ab33f6c546ca85e7d84a4e3c32cd4034.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>
<p>But I’m still confused about the different architectures and what I should do when building for publishing to app store!?</p>
