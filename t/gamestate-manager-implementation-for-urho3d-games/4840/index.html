<p>I’ve just finished implementing a gamestate manager, and I seek opinions, advice and comment from the gallery.<br/>
This is the third incarnation in as many days, however I’m pretty happy with the advantages that come with the design.<br/>
Here’s some quick notes I shoved into a ReadMe file that describe the key concepts:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>The gamestate manager resides in its own Scene, and can be fully serialized to remember user preferences.<br/>
It creates a toplevel node, with one child node (bearing one component) per gamestate.<br/>
I have implemented three example states: intro (splashscreen), main menu, and gameplay.</p>
<p>The gamestate components can disable and re-enable themselves on demand (see the Enter and Exit methods), and they remain resident at all times (but can unload/reload resources to reduce memory footprint).</p>
<p>This is not a stack based implementation, which means that any gamestate can in theory transition to any other,<br/>
and it also means that, in theory, multiple gamestates can be active simultaneously (although I did not provide an example).</p>
<p>The GamePlay gamestate creates and manages a secondary scene, which represents the game scene.<br/>
Since the game scene is separate to the manager scene, it can be serialized separately,<br/>
representing a snapshot of gameplay that can be saved and reloaded independently of the game manager / menu settings.<br/>
GamePlay has full access to the game scene at all times, and can manipulate it in any way.<br/>
The purpose of the GamePlay gamestate is not to implement game logic, but merely to provide<br/>
a means to manage the content of the game scene from outside of that scene.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>What I forgot to mention? GameStates are not aware they are being managed, or that a manager class exists.<br/>
This is achieved by implementing a custom event handler in the manager:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<pre><code>/// Event Handler: Change of GameState
void onStateChange(StringHash eventType, VariantMap&amp; eventData );
</code></pre>

<p>Interesting use of <code>Node</code>s.</p>
<p>Have you considered having the game state manager inherit (directly) from <code>Serializable</code> instead and giving it some attributes?</p>
<p>EDIT: …and to use it without a <code>Scene</code> (or any <code>Node</code>), instead registering it as a <em>subsystem</em>?</p>

<p>It already inherits serializable, its component based!</p>
<p>The file uploads here are very restrictive, I cant attach the xml I dumped from the manager and game scenes, but you can imagine them.</p>
<p>Screw it.</p>
<p>Here is the Manager Scene, it gets dumped by the Main Menu State for no particular raison.<br/>
Quoting XML on this site is also a bad, and possibly a security issue, I can’t post shit here, sad face <img alt=":frowning:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/51ea35e7c47bd75b6fa0d425ad2d734f.png" title=":frowning:"/></p>

<p>The master object, the game state manager, which could be a singleton or not, is derived from Object, not Component - it is still Serializable (though there is nothing worth serializing), and can do Eventing (which I use), it is not part of the scene, or any scene, but there is a node in a scene named after it, for sanity.</p>
<p>The GameStateManager is NOT registered as a subsystem, just a regular Object.<br/>
It only subscribes for ONE event - a custom event, the change gamestate event.</p>
<p>Changing gamestate involves calling Exit on the current state, calling Enter on the new state, and updating a pointer to the current (most recently entered) state, the third step being a courtesy for the next Exit.</p>

<p>I guess there’s many ways to approach this problem. <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/480f97b912eb537e18032299081e582a.png" title=":slight_smile:"/><br/>
Also I must say I’m not at all familiar with design patterns. Using <code>Node</code>s just seems a bit unnecessary to me in this case.</p>

<p>Here’s the files for the state manager as of today.<br/>
There’s not a whole lot to see, other than the implementation working as expected.</p>
<p>Press “space” on the “main menu state” (the one displaying FPS) to see the “game state”.<br/>
Escape to quit.</p>
<p>I’ve partially implemented a Loading state, and am currently figuring out character controller and background loading.</p>
<p>Before I run headfirst into walls, I like to set up a safe space for my game. This invariably begins with some kind of state management, whether it be FSM, or like this one, ISM. I won’t spend too much effort on anything until I have a solid foundation to build on.</p>
<p>With a suitable game state manager, we could do away with separate builds for the samples, and load them all in a single application, like bullet, like ogre. Not that I am complaining, just pointing out the obvious.</p>

<p>I implemented asynch scene loading, and have a character in my game scene.<br/>
Now working on character controller, soon I’ll have the character sample running under my state manager.</p>
<p>The key advantage of using a state manager, so far, is to separately serialize the content of the state manager, and the content of the game scene.</p>
<p>The idea is that something is alive, above the game scene, that can unload and reload the game scene, and save its state, without needing to be told how.</p>

<p>I also implemented my own game state manager in his project: <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/new-project-template/4428">New project template</a><br/>
It was a bit more complex, but maybe there’s something that I could borrow from your implementation to further improve it. I basically had <code>LevelManager</code> class, which handler what sort of screen is visible to the user and the <code>SceneManager</code> which was responsible for the background scene loading.</p>

<p>I deliberately went for less complexity - it started as a stack based thing, but I realized quickly that stack based stuff induces limits on the transitions, and that is not always a good thing - this implementation is ISM, infinite state machine, any state can transition to any other, and we don’t need to deal with the overhead</p>

<p>Yes I realized this pretty late, still I feel more comfortable with a proper state manager, than trying to kludge everything together somewhere else… and it makes a lot of sense to have a Loading state, that stays resident, and GUI elements (like menu items) that are not part of the game scene, not to be in the game scene.<br/>
Modularity has lots of advantages, including the ability to easily re-use the modules.</p>
