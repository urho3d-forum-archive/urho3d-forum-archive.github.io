<p>Within the Urho community I have noticed allot of projects in shaders that only support 1 language and personally after spending a while working on HLSL I lose the motivation to write it again. There are a few solutions to this problems.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Solution 1</span><br/>
Write a custom shader language that performs an offline compile to the target language, this solution would be a big undertaking but I feel there would be the benefit of optimisations for all shaders.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Solution 2</span><br/>
Use a cross compiller to convert between languages. I noticed there have Mojo in our 3rd party list but from my understanding it doesn’t have support for d3d11 or gl3. Therefore I’d recommend <a data-bbcode="true" href="https://github.com/James-Jones/HLSLCrossCompiler">https://github.com/James-Jones/HLSLCrossCompiler</a> as it supports all languages used in the engine.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Solution 3</span><br/>
Shader macros, this would involve making a shader in all languages that will change the default methods and variables we use to be the same in all languages. For example change GLSL vec3 and HLSL float3 to UFloat3.</p>

<p>I totally agree with the guys here and yes, it is really getting prominent with GLSL here. For me, it’s the cross platform nature and some shaders might work with GL ES as well (with some tweaking).  <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/95940790c23d98635b2a6d3f22657158.png" title=":wink:"/></p>

<p>You touch a larger point, contributing to Urho3D (on a level that is acceptable to be merged to the master) is hard.</p>
<p>Shaders or techniques, need to verify that all render API’s work.<br/>
For scripting, need to make bindings for both AS &amp; Lua.<br/>
Need to ensure components replicate &amp; serialize right.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I don’t see easy ways to make that easier <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/ab33f6c546ca85e7d84a4e3c32cd4034.png" title=":slight_smile:"/> Probably my “ideal game/rendering library” would actually have a much smaller scope to make it more accessible to devs and to keep maintenance sane®, but of course for Urho it’s too late to change, it has grown and one has to live with it.</p>

<p>I agree it may be to late to fix allot of the issues but i feel there is still improvements that can be made towards this. Although none of them are going to be small tasks to undertake. Shaders may be the easiest to fix currently. But you also brought up scripting and maybe a abstraction layer for registering functions to script could be made.</p>
<p>For Shaders an offline compiler may help for initial testing of shaders as it can point out any errors before you test in all API’s.</p>

<p>It looks like UE4 is taking a similar approach to this, they also used mesa glsl optimiser but then changed the input to accept hlsl:<br/>

<p>very true but from my understanding they where a d3d11 only engine at the time and most of the work was put into the engine itself and not as much with the shaders</p>
<p>[quote=“Sinoid”]<br/>
A more realistic approach would be to start with BGFX’s ShaderC and maul it into something more tolerable and not dependent on BGFX. It’s at least relatively modern already, as opposed to hlsl2glsl or hlslparser. Also doable solo and able to nicely sit outside (or inside if later deemed worthy).[/quote]<br/>
BGFX’s ShaderC looks very good,  it looks like it takes in hlsl and compiles to both glsl and hlsl but I’m not to sure. it also looks like a perfect setup for a visual editor like what codingmonkey suggested.</p>

<p>The way this should (IMO) be done is that the compilation preserves all <span class="hashtag">#ifdefs</span> present in the shader code.</p>
<p>In the dark ages we used to be forced to enumerate the shader permutations beforehand, and indeed for example all HLSL permutations would be precompiled offline, but this was clumsy. Now, with HLSL, it compiles during runtime and writes the compiled permutations into binary files inside the shader cache directory for fast loading the next time, but this isn’t mandatory, and on GLSL a similar mechanism isn’t possible at all.</p>

<p>Right, compile or load from cache is the best approach, this is fine until you get in account compute shaders, D3DCompiler is very slow to compile them on runtime, I saw an example where it can take up to 1minutes or something.</p>

</aside>
<p>So yep there’s already glslang from Khronos which takes GLSL in and converts to SPIR-V. Google’s shaderc uses it as a library with their own interface.</p>
<p>The closest thing I’d image happening is like this:<br/>
<a data-bbcode="true" href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~airlied/virglrenderer/tree/src/vrend_shader.c" rel="nofollow noopener">http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~airlied/virglrenderer/tree/src/vrend_shader.c</a></p>
<p>This code is part of virgl (which is essentially a Gallium ‘OpenGL’ driver which supports multiple state trackers on top, and converts TGSI bytecode to GLSL). Just replace TGSI with SPIR-V and there you go, outputs probably human-unreadable GLSL.</p>
<p>On a side-note I’d very much like to see a virvulkan in future, use Gallium’s plethora of state trackers (including the DX9 one) and run it on any Vulkan-capable driver. That would super-charge a whole back-catalogue of DX9-only games for SteamOS potentially…</p>

<p>With C++ expression templates can be used to generate either HLSL/GLSL from C++ code.<br/>
A library like Boost.Proto can be used to do it: <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/doc/html/proto.html" rel="nofollow noopener">boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/do … proto.html</a></p>
<p>That could be a really interesting project.<br/>
For an example check out VexCL library: <a href="https://github.com/ddemidov/vexcl" rel="nofollow noopener">github.com/ddemidov/vexcl</a></p>

<p>bgfx actually uses shader macros to bridge gap between shader languages. Since languages are similar enough there isnt much that needs to be done through macros either. Every shader is supposed to include and use this: <a href="https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx/blob/master/src/bgfx_shader.sh" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx/blob/master/src/bgfx_shader.sh</a></p>
<p>Is shaderc really required with bgfx? From quick look seems like it could be totally optional.</p>
<p>Considering bgfx port is under way, maybe adopting bgfx approach could be a good idea?</p>
<p>Edit: someone also pointed me to this: <a href="https://github.com/mellinoe/ShaderGen" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/mellinoe/ShaderGen</a>. It is not exactly production-ready, but interesting nevertheless.</p>

<p>Shader macros, this would involve making a shader in all languages that will change the default methods and variables we use to be the same in all languages</p>

<p>Matrix multiplication and array initialization would become a bit ugly, but marco should be fine.</p>
