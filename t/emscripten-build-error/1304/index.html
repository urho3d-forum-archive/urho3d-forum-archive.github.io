<p>We (at least I) haven’t upgraded and tried the build with 1.34.x. Emscripten team is busy at work as usual. It is not the first time I found their newer releases break our build requiring us to make corresponding adjustment on our side and/or forcing us to send PR upstream to fix them. But I am not sure yet if that is your problem here. Could you temporarily downgrade to 1.33.x and see how far you can go with that version. If it is ok with 1.33 then you know you haven’t done something wrong with your setup.</p>

I am upgrading the Emscripten toolchain for our CI build from 1.33.1 (incoming) to 1.34 (master) as I speak. If everything goes smoothly then the next Emscripten CI build will be using 1.34.</p>

<p>My Urho3D version is the master as at 2017-12-10 (yesterday at the time of this post) and my emscripten version is 1.37.22. I actually followed the installation guide of emscripten carefully and equally set up its environment variable but somehow the value of EMSCRIPTEN_ROOT_PATH in  CMake/Toolchains/Emscripten.cmake evaluates to C:/Program Files/Emscripten/emscripten/1.34.4. I have no idea where that came from.</p>

<p>Clearly it’s just a development environment setup problem. I have not tried to target Web platform on Windows host but I believe the environment setup should be similar to Linux.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the EM portable SDK (manager)</li>
<li>Activate one of the EM SDK (and Binaryen as well if want to use WASM instead of asm.js)</li>
<li>Invoke the <code>emsdk_env</code> shell/batch file which sets the environment variables (only required to do for subsequent environment setup, unless you have hard-wired those variables in your account’s profile which get set each time you login)</li>
<li>Invoke our CMake script and make as usual. On my box this is achieved in a one liner: <code>rake cmake web &amp;&amp; rake make web</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note the common cross-compiling pitfall on Windows though. Our build system requires both cross-compiler and native compiler toolchains to be available in the system PATH. This is almost the case for any Linux host with dev packages installed. On Windows this is not so, and you have to take care of it yourself. Usually by having a MinGW compiler toolchain in your path would help. Good luck.</p>

<p>After some years I decided to return back to this and try emscripten once again. Long story short I still had build errors but I consider it as progress nonetheless.</p>
<p>This error however is of the compiler complaining of redefinition of classes and I am confused why it should be so.</p>

<p>Just to be sure nothing is wrong with the source files ( which I am assure I didn’t touch any code in it) I had to build for windows platform using mingw and everything built well.</p>
<p>From the little I could investigate, it turned out that the compiler was referencing two different sets of header files; one in <span class="math">{urho3d-dir}/</span>{build-folder}/include and the other header files in the same folder as their respective source file in  ${urho3d-dir}/Source/Urho3D.</p>
<p>I would really appreciate any assistance here to help me resolve this.</p>

So I finally got it resolved. Turns out that <code>Source/Urho3D/Graphics/OpenGL/OGLGraphics.cpp</code> had this line</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">#ifdef __EMSCRIPTEN__
#include "../Input/Input.h"
#include "../UI/Cursor.h"
#include "../UI/UI.h"
</code></pre>
<p>Which has a wrong relative include. So I changed it to</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">#ifdef __EMSCRIPTEN__
#include "../../Input/Input.h"
#include "../../UI/Cursor.h"
#include "../../UI/UI.h"
</code></pre>
<p>…and the build succeeded without errors. Just to be sure, I tried compiling a sample application with the resulting lib and it was successful too.</p>
<p>A PR with the fix has been submitted on github.</p>
