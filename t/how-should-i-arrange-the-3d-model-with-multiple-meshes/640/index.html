<p>I have tried to generate the mdl file by using AssetImporter tools in MacOS.</p>
<h1>Case 1:</h1>
<p>I used samuzai_animation_ok.FBX (free 3D model package from Unity Assetstore).<br/>
I got the following errors.</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>Skeleton with multiple root nodes found, not supported</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<h1>Case 2:</h1>
<p>I used my own 3D model and I got this error message because I have more than 64 bones.</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>Geometry has too many bone influences</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>My questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>How should I prepare the 3D model with multiple meshes to use in Urho3D?</li>
<li>Is there any guideline for preparing the models in 3D Authoring Tools, such as Maya Lite, 3DS Max, to use in Urho3D?</li>
<li>Can somebody share me the proper working fbx file?</li>
</ol>
<p>PS: I have double checked with my using fbx files with “Autodesk FBXViewer (From FBXConverterUI Tools)” and “Autodesk FBXReview Tools”. There is no issue with my fbx files.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Skeleton with multiple root nodes found, not supported<br/>
you must connect (make keep offset relation) these separeted bones to one Master bone or Root bone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Geometry has too many bone influences<br/>
no more then 4-bones on one vertex influence i suppose.<br/>
to limit count of influents on vertex it’s work for your 3d editor.</p>

<p>The bone influence error message is a bit poorly worded. What it means is that there’s a maximum of 64 bones per submesh. This means that if for example your model has a complex face rig, its face should be a separate submesh (in modeling programs this is usually be achieved by using another material on it) to not overshoot the limit. Meanwhile the body submesh could use another 64 bones.</p>
<p>If there are more than 4 bones influencing a single vertex, the extra influences (starting from lowest weights) will be dropped and that isn’t a fatal error.</p>

<p>Dear codingmonkey and cadaver,</p>
<p>Thanks for your answers.</p>
<p>Please allow me to clarify one more question.<br/>
Is there any maximum meshes per model?</p>

<p>Not really, but the more you have, the more inefficient rendering will be (more draw calls).</p>

<p>I’m new here and i have two questions if I may:</p>
<p>1:  is the 64 bones per submesh limit still 64 in the github master branch?</p>
<p>and 2: I downloaded the ver 1.32 “release” and prefer to use release versions versus using w.i.p respositories – around the Urho3D community forums here; which version is the standard to use?  I ask this rather odd question because another engine i had been using for the past year prefers users to use the next version repositiry after it has reached a certain level of development even though its official release stage is still months away.  So I just want to make sure to follow with the community but i also much prefer to use “official releases” as they usually will be considered “production-ready” and I am very eager to get my game going <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/c16ddadcbd525aa6d219a1df596d362f.png" title=":smiley:"/></p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, seems so.<br/>
I think there is the same limit in <span class="bbcode-b">reattiva</span>’s Blender exporter: <a href="https://github.com/reattiva/Urho3D-Blender">github.com/reattiva/Urho3D-Blender</a><br/>
It refers to this as a limitation of HW-skinning? In any case it’s really nice.</p>

<p>I’m not sure about usage statistics. Many do work with and discuss the master branch, including those working on Urho3D, other projects, or both.<br/>
I stick with the master branch for various reasons; it’s always worked great for me, slips in new features, and I’m constantly impressed with how smooth updates are. …due to good design and management, not a lack of development.  <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/480f97b912eb537e18032299081e582a.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>
<p>On the other hand, since the API seems fairly well-defined, it should not be difficult to update only releases and you should find most of the discussion relevant.<br/>
Just my 2 cents.</p>
