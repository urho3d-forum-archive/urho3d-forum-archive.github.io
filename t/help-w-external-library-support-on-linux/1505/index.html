<p>Building Urho3D has been pretty easy. No problems there. But I’m embarrassed to admit how long I’ve been working to get the cmake system to work properly with Urho3D as an external library, on Linux.</p>
<p>What I’ve done:<br/>
Cloned the repo<br/>
created Urho3D/build<br/>
configured cmake via cmake-gui to use build.<br/>
Made Urho3D into build as a static library.</p>
<p>At this point all the demos in build/bin work without issue. Cool beans! Next I create an external project directory. I reference [http]://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.5/_using_library.html. I specifically note this part of the page.</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>You must adjust the URHO3D_HOME environment variable in your build. In release 1.4 onward, the URHO3D_HOME environment variable is supposed to <span class="bbcode-b">point to the build tree of the Urho3D project.</span> In prior releases, the URHO3D_HOME was supposed to point to Urho3D project root itself.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So I, “export URHO3D_HOME=/home/blah/project/Urho3D/build”. Side note, setting this or changing its value doesn’t seem to have any impact.<br/>
I create my CMakeLists.txt per the instructions.<br/>
No mention of a build directory is made on the page, but I go ahead and create one. I’ve also tried without. No change.<br/>
So, via cmake-gui, the source directory is set as the root of my project and the build directory is set as the build directory.<br/>
Tell it to configure. Get errors:</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Interestingly enough, neither of those files exist inside the Urho3D tree. So no idea why it says it needs to locate files which simply don’t exist.</p>
<p>So, moving on, I set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to “Debug”. Now I’m specifically left with Urho3D_DIR. I’ve tried just about every combination I can imagine and nothing seems to make it happy. Regardless of the assigned value it’s always reset back to ‘Urho3D_DIR-NOTFOUND’. Which I guess it makes sense as the comments imply it should find of the files which has never existed.</p>
<p>Now then, I eventually did get things to work, but that was with actually installing things into /usr/local, via, “make install”, however, that’s not what I desire.</p>
<p>So, please feel free to kick me in the seat and tell me what I’m doing wrong. And in case it’s not clear, heeeeellllpppp!  <img alt=":frowning:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/2506cac83464f3f86e257fa414340d4c.png" title=":frowning:"/></p>

<p>Ok, so you have the Urho3D source folder, and a build folder. And set the URHO3D_HOME environment variable.<br/>
so far so good.</p>
<p>This is what I do.</p>
<p>I have a project folder, example “/urho_project”.<br/>
Inside this folder I have a “/bin” folder and a “/src” folder.<br/>
And from the docs a "CMakeLists.txt"<br/>
as well, I have this script, that I call "/link.sh"<br/>
So I have so far:</p>
<p>[ul]<br/>
/urho_project<br/>
/urho_project/bin<br/>
/urho_project/src<br/>
/urho_project/link.sh<br/>
/urho_project/CMakeLists.txt<br/>
[/ul]</p>
<p>Use the script passing in the path to the Urho3D source directory.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sh ./link.sh /Urho3D</code></pre>
<p>Pardon my bash, but it works:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">#!/bin/bash

#i need to create a bin folder if it does not exists

#setup.sh /Urho3D_Source
#needs 1 arguents, the urho source folder

  if [ ! -e $3 ];then
    #link does not exist, we can make it
    ln -s $2 $3
    echo "          -"$1" directory LINKED"
  else
    echo "          -"$1" link ALREADY EXISTS"
  fi
}

URHOPATH=$1
#first make sure that the given folder is good

if [ $# -eq 0 ];then
  echo "***********************************"
  echo "no arguments given, please provide:"
  echo "     -urho source path"

    echo "     -link CMake, CoreData and Data folders"

    if [ -f "$EFILE" ];then
      printf "$EDIT" &gt; $EFILE
      echo "     -editor.sh edited"
    else
      touch $EFILE

<p>What this script does it a few things.<br/>
It makes some necessary symbolic links.</p>
<p>[ul]<br/>
/urho_project/bin/CoreData<br/>
/urho_project/bin/Data"<br/>
/urho_project/CMake<br/>
[/ul]</p>
<p>Side note: The bash script also creates another bash script called “<a href="http://editor.sh">editor.sh</a>” I do this cause I usually modify it to pass in variables specific to my project as far as renderpaths that I want to editor to use, etc.</p>
<p>For completion, here is my CMakeLists.txt with a modification that searches sub folders in my “/src” directory:</p>

<p>Thank you so much!</p>
<p>While I didn’t mention it, I was already linking CoreData and Data. I wasn’t, however, linking CMake at the root level. That instantly made everything happy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You <span class="bbcode-u">may want</span> to copy (or symlink) the ‘CMake’ subdir from Urho3D project root directory</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I double checked the reference documentation (link above) and the phrasing implies this is optional. Linking or copying the CMake directory is clearly mandatory and not something you may want to consider. In retrospect I should have given it a go since it is specifically mentioned as optional. Perhaps the documentation will be updated to indicate it is in fact mandatory, not optional?</p>
<p>Sweet! Thanks so much!</p>

<p>There is an even simpler way, especially since you are using Linux as Ruby/Rake is already preinstalled. Execute this in the Urho3D project root (Urho3D repo clone dir).</p>
