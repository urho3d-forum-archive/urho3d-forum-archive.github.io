<p>What is the best way to deal with the viewport on Android? Considering that a app can run on a small phone 480x853 or a full Android tablet around 1280 width view. I seen about a dozen different size standards.</p>
<p>The biggest issue is with font. My thoughts was make a window 480x853 then scale up.</p>

<p>That would be the same solution with responsive websites and web apps which is having a separate UI design for mobile or smaller screens. If your UI is simple enough then you would just worry about scaling and screen ratio.</p>

<p>I was thinking the same thing. The easiest and I guess the less complicated is to have maybe 3 screen designs. Then select size of UI to use depending on the screen resolutions.</p>
<p>It’s not the best solution but the UI is not complicated, and complicated solution for something minor is time consuming and might over complicated something that literally take minutes to do.</p>

<p>In mobile you can have very different screens / aspect ratio. It is common to create assets at the highest resolution possible (uhd, 2048x1536 ipad like / android xxxhdpi screen) and then SCALE DOWN to intermediate screens (hd, 1920x1080) and low density screens (800x640 android or iphone 5 something). This is about 2d assets. About 3d… you probably end up choosing a favorite / design resolution and following the same route…<br/>
NEVER scale up…</p>

<p>I would not take such a hard position on scaling up. Scaling up should work fine (and is probably the best/only choice) for certain retro-style projects (pixel art, arcade style games, for example). Other than that, I agree, scaling down is always the way you should go, or your assets will likely end up looking blurry on higher resolution devices.</p>
