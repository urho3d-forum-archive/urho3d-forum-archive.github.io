<p>I implemented cooperative multitasking for Urho3D. Simply put you can now write code like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cpp">
void TasksSample::MushroomAI()
{
    // Implement mushroom logic.
    const char* mushroomText[] = {
        "Q: Mummy, why do all the other kids call me a hairy werewolf?",
        "A: Now stop talking about that and brush your face!",
        "Q: What did one thirsty vampire say to the other as they were passing the morgue?",
        "A: Let’s stop in for a cool one!",
        "Q: How can you tell if a vampire has a horrible cold?",
        "A: By his deep loud coffin!",
        "Q: What do skeletons say before eating?",
        "A: Bone Appetit!",
        "Q: Why did the vampire get fired from the blood bank?",
        "A: He was caught drinking on the job!",
        "Q: What is a vampire’s pet peeve?",
        "A: A Tourniquet!",
    };

    // This task runs as long as title node exists in a scene.
    WeakPtr&lt;Node&gt; titleNode(scene_-&gt;GetChild("MushroomTitle", true));
    for (;!titleNode.Expired();)
    {
        auto index = Random(0, SDL_arraysize(mushroomText) / 2);
        auto text3D = titleNode-&gt;GetComponent&lt;Text3D&gt;();

        // Mushroom says a joke question
        text3D-&gt;SetText(mushroomText[index * 2]);
        // And waits for 5 seconds. This does not block rendering.
        SuspendTask(5.f);

        // After 5 seconds mushroom tells an answer.
        text3D-&gt;SetText(mushroomText[index * 2 + 1]);
        SuspendTask(3.f);

        // And after 3 more seconds laughs.
        text3D-&gt;SetText("Hahahahaha!!!");
        // Next joke comes after 3 seconds.
        SuspendTask(3.f);

        // SuspendTask() may be called without arguments. Execution will be resumed on the next frame.
        SuspendTask();
    }
}

void TasksSample::SubscribeToEvents()
{
    // Create a task that will be scheduled each time E_UPDATE event is fired.
    GetTasks()-&gt;Create(E_UPDATE, std::bind(&amp;TasksSample::MushroomAI, this));
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>MushroomAI()</code> code is written as if it executed sequentially and yet <code>SuspendTask()</code> calls do not block rendering even though code runs on the main thread. If you wish you may implement task scheduling on other threads as well. It is implemented in a cross-platform and efficient way. On windows it uses fiber API. On unixes it uses ucontext for first context switch and _setjmp/_longjmp for following context switches. No assembly code used.</p>

</aside>
<p>What do you mean? It would run perfectly on platforms that support ucontext and some version of c standard, which is just about any platform supported by urho. Including MacOS (although it is true that they deprecated ucontext), iOS, Android, raspberry pi, arm/arm64/x86/x64. I am not so sure how it would fare on consoles. One thing that i am sure of - if this does not work on certain platforms then it is not too hard to make it work <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/58bcd684421190f24be1944e2a997a04.png" title=":wink:"/></p>

<p>Sure you can. What you would do is:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cpp">if (isConditionSet)
{
    // signal was received, do things
}
SuspendTask();    // Schedule other tasks, resume on next frame.
</code></pre>
<p>Or you can manually switch to tasks. API still needs a bit of work to allow sidestepping scheduler completely, but in theory you can totally do <code>task-&gt;SwitchTo()</code>, task is scheduled and execution resumes after this method call as soon as task calls <code>SuspendTask()</code>.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That is not how tasks work. Tasks are like micro-threads. If you want task to resume when some signal is sent you probably want to do it manually - receive signal and call <code>task-&gt;SwitchTo()</code> which will schedule task.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Same way as you would do it with threads: set condition variable somewhere and have task check it constantly. You do not want to have and use <code>task-&gt;Terminate()</code> for example, because it would free task stack without unwinding it and possibly cause memory leaks.</p>

</aside>
<p>You would have to implement that part. Maybe like some kind of queue that task is constantly checking, getting items from it and processing once you put something in there?</p>

<p>Thanks,<br/>
I’m just raising a few questions to understand the capability of the implementation.</p>
<p>The reason I’m asking about interrupt and signal is when you would use it for ai character, where the ai could do multiple tasks concurrently.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>

<p>Yes, that is exactly the point of task system - doing multiple things at one (but not in parallel).</p>
<p>For example you could have <code>AttackTask()</code> which actively looks for enemies around and attacks them.</p>
<p>Then you could have <code>HealTask()</code> which checks HP every X seconds and consumes healing potions.</p>
<p>Then you could have <code>ReactTask()</code> which would check HP every X seconds and once it reaches 10% or less it would make NPC scream “AHHHH!!!” and flee.</p>
<p>Now logical thing would be to terminate <code>AttackTask()</code> when <code>ReactTask()</code> initiates fleeing. NPC could have <code>state_</code> member variable which could be <code>AGGRESSIVE</code> or <code>FRIGHTENED</code>, and <code>AttackTask()</code> then would only make NPC attack if it is in <code>AGGRESSIVE</code> state.</p>
<p>Not the best AI design but i hope it illustrates how to do things concurrently.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@George1</span> i worked on it a bit more and added <code>task-&gt;Terminate()</code> method to request task termination. <code>SuspendTask()</code> throws exception in the task, this unwinds the stack properly and prevents any memory leaks i mentioned earlier. If exception cost is too high you may manually keep checking <code>task-&gt;IsTerminating()</code> before every <code>SuspendTask()</code> call and return from the task, avoiding throwing exception.</p>
<p>Updated sample, adding multiple examples to that worker thread function demonstrating how various things work. Also added example on how to manually schedule tasks without using task scheduler.</p>
<p>Hope you find it useful</p>
