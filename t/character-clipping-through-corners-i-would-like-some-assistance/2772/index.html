<p>EDIT: Disabling gravity seems to eliminate the problem, but only when the character is off the floor.</p>
<p>I have a project set up with a character controller that clips through the corners of the level’s geometry.<br/>
You can waltz right on through most (interior) corners just by walking into them while turning. If you don’t manage to walk through, the character will still jitter around.</p>
<p><img height="408" src="//cdck-file-uploads-global.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/1X/56b828633f9f55ee7f6fb8631387b526c05da101.png" width="690"/></p>
<p>I find this corner here the most blasphemous, so use that for testing.</p>
<p>The level geometry is a static rigid body with a triangle mesh collider, and the character has the angular factor disabled and a cylinder collision shape. My character is driven by setting its velocity manually for better control. I do not have much experience with physics engines yet, so I would appreciate some pointers (heh) on how to handle this.<br/>
I have already tried using swept collision for the character as well as messing with the collision margins for both the character and the level.</p>
<p>You can take a look at my project files here:<br/>

You might have to re-set the include directories if you want to compile it yourself.</p>

<p>I downloaded your zip file and tried it and verified that the player drops off at the particular corner you mentioned along with other full wall corners that I tested.<br/>
Then I changed your “playerstart” cylinder to capsule:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>  &lt;component type="CollisionShape" id="16778942"&gt;
  	&lt;attribute name="Shape Type" value="Capsule" /&gt;
  	&lt;attribute name="Size" value="4 14 4" /&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>and the penetration problem stopped. I couldn’t tell you if there is a problem with Bullet’s cylinder collision or not but it’s leaning that way.</p>

<p>Thank you very much, sir! Changing it to a capsule seems to have worked. I had originally planned on using a capsule, but it gave me trouble when working with slopes. However, that problem seems to have magically disappeared.</p>
<p>I might also add that the corner shown below triggers a “btAssert(!fuzzyZero())” in Debug Mode. It doesn’t do that in Release, however, so I guess it’s not to be worried about yet.<br/>

<p>I’ve come across a similar problem in one of my other projects, but I found out that if I introduced a second collision shape to the character controller (in this case, a sphere) and put it near the midsection the character no longer clips through the wall.</p>
