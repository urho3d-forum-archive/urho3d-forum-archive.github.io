<p>Many thanks to <span class="mention">@weitjong</span> for helping me get a build to work on the pi.</p>
<p>Currently still haven’t got it to work without x running. However, installing only xorg with no desktop and running via xinit seems to be a decent compromise in the mean time.</p>
<p>The demos run with as much performance as I need / expected from a pi4, with a nice frame rate on the simpler ones.</p>
<p>Except - they all freeze for a split second roughly every 3 seconds. It’s not intermittent, it’s quite regular, and happens on every demo I’ve tried.</p>
<p>I guess this is more a pi issue than Urho but any suggestions on what it might be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>The pi is running the 32bit Raspberry Pi OS lite (no desktop installed)</p>
<p>The only things I’ve installed are the libs for Urho, smb, git, and xorg. When I check htop I can’t see anything obvious using the resources.</p>
<p>So close…</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>I don’t remember Urho having any kind of periodic job that may cause this kind of lag.<br/>
Try to reduce frame rate in options (what’s your FPS btw?), maybe your gpu gets overfed with commands or something.</p>

<p>Frame rate is solid 60fps (except the lag obviously) in the 2d physics demo (the one I’m interested in) at 1920x1080</p>
<p>More like 18 in the Character demo one.</p>
<p>Is there a way to limit the framerate without modifying the source of the actual app? Can’t see anything like that in the runtime flags. Full disclosure I have never developed anything with Urho (yet). I’m currently speccing it to see if it will will work for my project performance wise (seems like it will!)</p>
<p>Although the lag still happens in the heavier demos so I suspect it isn’t related to framerate.</p>

<p>RockPro64 with rk3399. It required lots of other workarounds as well, particularly on ARM devices.<br/>
You will lose runtime joystick detection however.</p>

<p>Haven’t tested on new Pi4 yet, but I don’t remember observing freeze on my older Pi for those simple demos. The only artifacts I recall is the skeleton demo caused by not enough uniform and slow frame rate on physics stress test and water demo. It was last tested quite a few years ago using older code version in the repo. It was also without X draining the computing power. The Pi has its memory configuration altered to optimize for 3D application.</p>
<p>Have you tried to configure your Pi4 to have more ram allocated to the GPU? Newer Raspbian uses non-proprietary graphics driver, but I am not sure yet how much it affects performance on Urho3D.</p>
<p>PS. The newer Pi4 has more uniforms. I believe we could change the bone limit now when targeting Pi4. That should fix the skeleton animation demo artifact. That’s one of the things I wanted to do while waiting for my Pi4 to arrive at the time. Hope I can find time in the near future to finish the experiment.</p>
