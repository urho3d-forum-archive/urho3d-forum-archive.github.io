I don’t really follow other engines but this seems to be some mayor news. Quite interesting what other engines are working on.<br/>
They worked a lot on character stuff like on improving skin, eyes, cloth shadowing and ground shadowing.</p>
<p>They also improved hair rendering but it stills looks weird: Looks more like nylon or spider web threads.<br/>

Maybe that’s because there are no shadows in the hair? It also looks kinda grainy and the strands seem rather thick. Could still be improved but I guess it’s getting better in general. Compared to the rest of the characters the hair looks way more unrealistic I think.</p>
<p>Also interesting that many, even recent, CGI movies look worse as some of the Unreal images.</p>
