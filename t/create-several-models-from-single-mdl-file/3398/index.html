<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I encountering a quite strange issue. I have create an object model under Blender and I would like to use that single model to create several objects within my application.<br/>
I create N nodes and for each one, I create a static model from the resource related to the model file “Models/Gate.mdl”.<br/>
Here is the code snippet I use…</p>
<pre><code>for(i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
{
  Node *myNode = mScene-&gt;CreateChild("Gate" + String(i));
  myNode-&gt;SetPosition(Vector(…, …, …));
  StaticModel *myModel = myNode-&gt;CreateComponent&lt;StaticModel&gt;();
  myModel-&gt;SetModel(mResourcesCache-&gt;GetResource&lt;Model&gt;("Models/Gate.mdl"));
  myModel-&gt;ApplyMaterialList();
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, when I execute that code, I have some strange behaviors when I look at the objects. It seems that sometimes or depending on my camera position, some are visible and other are not, and they appear and disappear in a random fashion.<br/>
So my main question is : is it possible (and maybe relevant) to create several objects from the same unique resource ? Do I have to duplicate the model resource to have one duplicated resource associated with one node ? I mean that if I create 10 nodes, do I have to create 10 different resources of the same model ?<br/>
It is a little bit confusing to me, so any clarifications would be very welcome.</p>
<p>My best regards !</p>

<p>Absolutely !.See example20  huge object count.The whole point of resources are to share them whenever possible.</p>
<p>" I have some strange behaviors when I look at the objects. It seems that sometimes or depending on my camera position, some are visible and other are not, and they appear and disappear in a random fashion."</p>
<p>This is more likely a bounding box issue.Can you debug your geometry aabb ?</p>

<p>Hi Dave,<br/>
thanks for your quick answer. I had a look at the “HugeObjectCount.cpp” file and it gives a clear answer to my question.<br/>
I should have had a look at it first before posting my question on the forum, I apologize <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/95940790c23d98635b2a6d3f22657158.png" title=":wink:"/> I will take care of the provided examples for next times.<br/>
Anyway, this really helps and I did not know about the StaticModelGroup class. It seems to be very useful.<br/>
Thanks !</p>

<p>Also some people encounter issue similar to yours with auto-instancing. Try to disable it and see<br/>
if that fixes your problem. Instancing from resources should work without StaticModelGroup too<br/>
and without side-effects.</p>
