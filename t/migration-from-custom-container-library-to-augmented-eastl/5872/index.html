<p>Okay, I’m gonna extract this question into separate thread to keep discussion on-topic.</p>
<p>Currently there’s very good opportunity to move Urho from custom containers to proper 3rd party container library. Most of the porting is already done.</p>
<p>The issue is that this change is breaking. There are adapters that covers common cases but they don’t provide 100% backward compatibility. And names are not in <code>CamelCase</code> /outcry of shock/.</p>
<p>What this migration offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Container library maintained by <em>companies</em> instead of custom-made library that nobody maintains;</li>
<li>Move-semantics friendly containers;</li>
<li>Containers that don’t allocate memory dynamically;</li>
<li>Algorithms;</li>
</ul>
<p>Why one may want this change?</p>
<p>When a person is used to work with <code>std</code> container library in its entirety (more than just <code>vector.push_back</code>), using custom Urho Containers becomes a pain. There’re so many things missing. I have refactored <code>Urho3D::Vector&lt;T&gt;</code> two times when I needed something from it and it’s not even close to “enough”.</p>
<p>Small buffer optimization? Nope. Allocators? Nope. Algorithms? Nope. Containers except vector and hash map? Nope. Move semantics? Barely. Spans and string views? Nope.</p>
<p>Urho is outsourcing physics, navigation, image decoding and tons of other tasks. Why it cannot outsource container library too?</p>
<p>So, what do you think? Is it worth it?</p>

<p>Are there any tests comparing Urho and EASTL containers? As far as I understand, Urho3D containers are designed to binding with scripting languages and work fast. Who forbids users to use their own containers in their projects? I am not against progress, however, the loss of binding to scripting languages is a regression. C # cannot replace scripting languages because you cannot quickly call managed code from native code. You can only quickly call native code from managed code.</p>

<p>When I checked last time, script bindings are not heavily dependent on exact container types. They will need some revise, but I think it’s doable.</p>
<p>About performance… measuring performance properly is hard task that requires time and effort. I may try it when I have time for it.</p>

This topic is about this specific feature <em>that I personally missed in Urho for years</em>.</p>

People want to use Urho. Not some <em>fork</em>, but the master branch. I’m one of these people, but there are more. This is given.<br/>

<p>Could you guys pro stl changes divide the issue a little bit? Pls explain the eastl introduction to Urho3D a little technical detailed?</p>
<p>As a proposal, shall we list merits and demerits? Challenges and opportunities? Future plans?</p>
<p>There will be a lot of code changes to Urho as well as your own code. If we gain more, only cost the unification and aesthetics of the engine, its opportunity.</p>
<p>I like the current containers, since they are just simple and good for my usage. But obviously, many people ask more and have their own needs and pains.</p>
<p>Edit: I have to point out that, ***’s Editor is not because of the container changes, it is mainly because of the auther’s hard working. I really respect that. So, I don’t want to mix the ***’s features with the introduction of stl.</p>
<p>There are many people who are silent in this community, including the leaders and ex-leaders, they may have their own private fork or workflow, or have quit using Urho, but for the containers change, please stand out and speak out.</p>

<p>I support this idea unless it turns Urho into a gargantuan giant monster where opening the project in the IDE takes 10 minutes , the building process takes 1 hour and the resulted binary is over 30 mb … Also i expect smooth out of box Cmake scripts without any hassle over fixing broken cumbersome scripts. Right now the cmake scripts (at least on windows) are perfect !! I download Urho3d , build it and start working on my game.</p>

<p>I too am quite fond of this consistency, and if it would break over this, I think it would be better to use <code>std</code> (to avoid the road to Boost) and change the Urho code style accordingly <em>or</em> leave things the way they are.</p>

<p>If the community is convinced, as long as EASTL itself alone does not break things too much, we may provide some scripts/way to help people migrate their own projects.</p>
<p>As for AngelScript, can we make things automatic? like SWIG for C#? So we just keep lua, AngelScript and scripts based Editor, as long as we don’t have a better alternative yet so discarding any of the parts are not considerable. If people love C#, use it.</p>
<p>So, everyone is happy and Urho is stronger. Am I asking too much (based on the community size and contributor number)?</p>

<p>One concern I have with the benchmark is that it may be more of a test of the incremental creation of the strings than of the actual containers. What is you used the same object type for all of the containers (maybe key type as well for the maps, but I understand that might be an issue since the hash function needs to exist).</p>
<p>Also, the suggestion is to break comparability and internal Urho consistency in exchange for a (potentially) better preforming set of containers (and likely greater comparability with external library’s that likely use the stl containers (which I believe share the same function names as EASTL, though not the same classes)).</p>

<p>Proposed compatibility changes differ in scope by the orders of magnitude. Smaller breaking change is always better than bigger breaking change, unless you have <em>strong</em> arguments for doing bigger change.</p>
<p>Consistently is weak argument. Urho way to wrap everything is perfectionism borderline to mental disorder. We have garbage code that is suboptimal and need to be maintained just to have fancy names.</p>
<p>Cmon, why on earth do we need Sqrt? Especially considering that we don’t wrap everything because it is impossible to wrap everything. So Urho is already inconsistent. The moment user wants to use anything from standard library, consistency is gone.</p>
<p>So what if we return vector instead of Vector? We already return bool and not Bool, and we use initializer_list instead of… whatever.</p>

<p>About std containers, since you all keep mentioning them.</p>
<p>You see, I included std and EASTL in the same vote option for a reason. In order to switch to std, you have to switch to EASTL first, and <em>then</em> switch even deeper. I’m not kidding. EASTL is exactly between Urho Containers and std so we will have to pass this point anyway.</p>
<p>So we can postpone all std-related questions until we completely switch to EASTL.</p>

<p>Same. I would <strong>LOVE</strong> to have snake_case codebase. At the same time it is a crazy undertaking. Not only because it is huge, but also because it is very error-prone. I have been there already. Switching to EASTL was not exactly easy. IDE could help only so much when renaming things. There always are code sections disabled by preprocessor where refactoring does not work. And when it works it isnt perfect. So who is going to do it?</p>

<p>Urho Containers doesn’t have standard interface in any way. They have custom API names and style (CamelCase), custom features that don’t really match <code>std</code>.</p>
<p>EASTL has standart API names and style (snake_case), and custom functionality (additional helper functions in containers and CamelCase bridges).</p>
<p><code>std</code> is, obviously, standard.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p>Urho: custom API, custom features;<br/>
EASTL: <code>standard</code> API, custom features;<br/>
<code>std</code>: <code>standard</code> API, <code>standard</code> features;</p>
<p>Every transition from “custom” to “<code>standard</code>” is manual and separate work in codebase.<br/>
So, transition from Urho to <code>std</code> is perfectly split into two phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Transition from Urho to EASTL, old interface is deprecated (partially removed and partially supported by adapters);</li>
<li>Transition from EASTL to <code>std</code>, old interface is removed.</li>

<p>Would you guys please shut up about adhoc99 and get back to topic.  He’s obviously not Modanung, any fool who’s been following this forum for any time at all can tell that.  His emotional tones and cadence of speech are <em>completely</em> different.  And no, I have no reason to believe that Modanung is some kind of sock puppet <em>actor</em> doing a great job playing multiple roles.  Get over yourselves and shut up about the personality tiffs already.</p>
<p>Asking for a monolithic port of EASTL and the removal of currently working code, is <em>foolish</em>.  People who actually care about this, should be devising <em>incremental</em> strategies to gradually introduce EASTL into Urho3D.  Triggered by appropriate build switches, for those who actually want it.  Until such a time as it is <em>feature complete</em> and <em>well tested</em> as compared to currently working code.</p>
<p>This is like Software Engineering 101, or at least Open Source 101.  So who of you is going to actually start <em>doing</em> this?</p>
<p>Maybe some of you don’t actually want to do this, you want the blessing for monolithic churn.  I personally don’t think anyone should be giving that!  YMMV.</p>
<p>Long boring merges like this are not exciting.  Maybe the political angle is to create enough excitement, to get a *** developer to actually do something.  Or convince a Urho3D developer to do something.  But that doesn’t actually matter past this moment, because what is proposed is a <em>marathon</em>.  You either have the discipline to run a marathon, or you <em>don’t</em>.  You are best off being honest with yourselves about this now, instead of starting something you <em>won’t</em> finish.</p>
<p>Pointing fingers at other people about what you want to have happen, isn’t how open source gets done.  Those who wish to champion the EASTL cause, <em>get to work</em> already.  You dig into the codebases, you find something you can refactor, you provide a build flag for it.  It’s boring and it’s not rocket science.  It doesn’t demand discussion.</p>
<p>Actually providing a minor build feature somewhere, is also proof-of-concept that you’re <em>serious</em>, that you intend to stay the course.</p>
<p>If you eyeball all of that, and decide it’s too much work in the real world, that’s fine.  Happens to me looking at open source projects all the time.</p>

<p>Asking for a monolithic port of EASTL and the removal of currently working code, is <em>foolish</em> . People who actually care about this, should be devising <em>incremental</em> strategies to gradually introduce EASTL into Urho3D. Triggered by appropriate build switches, for those who actually want it. Until such a time as it is <em>feature complete</em> and <em>well tested</em> as compared to currently working code.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>On the one hand, I do agree that a sudden and complete jump to EASTL may be inappropriate (unless we timed it to coincide with the start of Urho’s 2.0 work), I do feel the push for a build option enabling it is a pretty unreasonable request, as Eugene’s  <code>#ifdef</code> example illustrates. If your proposal is instead we wrap the EASTL classes for the most part so that we can still call, for example, Vector::Front(), with some exceptions for HashMap’s key value pairs,  I think that might be doable (though I still don’t know if that could be enabled with a build option - unless we change a couple features of the Urho containers like switching to <code>first</code> instead of <code>first_</code>). Then again, I haven’t looked much into how this would work, so others with more knowledge may be able to provide better insight.</p>
<p>Honestly though I don’t care too much about what version of a hash map and the like we use. There are a few changes I do want, however. Firstly, PODVector is still slightly broken, and it would be nice for Urho to not have subtle bugs that will corrupt the heap. Stepping through hundreds of graphics driver memory ‘issues’ (I have no idea if they actually are bugs or not) to get to the point where my program actually wrote to the wrong address to learn that it was because you couldn’t always Push a PODVector to itself was an awful experience.</p>
<p>Secondly, to ease the process of automatically generating script bindings without having to add a large number of annotations, I want every instance possible of <code>function(T* array, unsigned size)</code> to be replaced and/or supplemented by <code>function (span&lt;T&gt; array)</code>. (Replacement is my preference, but to avoid removing the existing API I would be content with simply adding the span function and then some additional work can be done to ignore the pointer,size overload)</p>
<p>If there is not strong opposition to the second, I will go ahead and start the work of adding span support to the library (and yes, I do plan on using EASTL for this). That would, I believe, meet your idea of gradually adding EASTL to Urho. I would like other’s feedback on this first, though, as I don’t like having all these pull requests lying around for features I’ve wanted that others were lukewarm to (particularly since the only thing I would directly gain from this is that my very, very side project of automatic script bindings might get easier).</p>

<p>Frankly speaking: accepting EASTL is bare minimum required in order to get a chance for future. Without it merging anything from *** will be too hard and nobody will step up to do that. Do we need it? Not even remotely. I am fine doing merges from upstream. I do them often and there is so little upstream activity that huge divergence is not a problem. Urho3D needs this however. I already did all the hard migration work and <span class="mention">@Eugene</span> did astounding job to ease transition by implementing container adapters. It does not get better than that.

<p>You are absolutely right, it makes no sense to argue that the project is stagnating. But let’s say we close the Urho3D project and rename *** to Urho 2.0. Will the number of developers increase? On my own, I can say that I just stay with the old version on my HDD, simply because there is functionality that I need. But in the new project I will not take part in the same way as I do not take part in the *** project.</p>

<p>Let me ask in all sincerity and not to offend anyone, if the reason *** was forked was for there to be a better alternative to the vanilla urho3d then why does there seem to be this aggressive push for urho3d to be like ***.

<p>These proposals were met with accepting attitude from one part of community, conservative scepticism of another part of communtiy, and outright aggression from the third part, which was the most unpleasant part.</p>

<p>Assuming this is a feature by feature thing (as opposed to a more personal thing - X, you accepted to work on the engine, Y, you are not), how about this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add relative path support to the engine. This allows the grouping of resources more easily by map section or character, so that within, for example, “Map/World1/Level1/node.xml” resources can be identified as “./tree1.mdl”, “./tree1leaves.png” without having to write out the full path for every resource. It also makes some situations of getting resources from the code simpler (I want the clothes.png file from the same directory as this character specification file, for example).</li>
<li>See 6 below</li>
<li>Existing resource loading will be changed (all of the GetResource type functions), requiring an additional parameter (a base path) or switching the String resourceName (i.e. path) parameters to a separate Path class so that the relative paths can be resolved. The extra parameter will be inserted before the bool argument as it should be grouped with the actual resource path requested rather than whether an event is sent on failure. It will have a default empty string parameter, so only the case of specifically requesting an event not be sent on failure will existing user code need to be changed (and possibly also custom resources will need to be modified).</li>
<li>That’s really not my job, but an engine that is easier to use is certainly not worse. Though you could argue that I have drawn at least one more user to the engine since my friend is now using it for his own project.</li>
<li>See 1. In terms of a cost-benefit, we gain support for relative paths at the cost of a <em>slight</em> increase in complexity in searching for a resource, which is likely not a bottleneck in anyone’s programs, so this should be fine.</li>
<li>I submitted a <a >Pull Request</a> for this addition two and a half years ago that is still open. Granted, since then I have let it grow out of date with Master so it needs an update to work again, but no one has really indicated support for or against it for over two years, so why would I bother updating the online branch when no one seems interested. I still use it, but I’d have to extract it from my other changes to the engine, which wouldn’t be hard, but I’d just be maintaining a PR that no one seems to want or explicitly not want.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Edit: A new thread has been created to discuss the above proposal. Please direct further comments about relative paths to <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/adding-relative-paths-to-resource-loading/5911">Adding Relative Paths to Resource Loading</a></strong></p>
<p>I wrote the above mostly as an illustration of why I think Eugene has asked these questions on the forum. Except for very minor bug fixes (which are almost always very shortly accepted if the coding standards were followed), Urho hasn’t always been too favorable towards adding functionality. It’s not that it’s been particularly unfavorable either, but I can’t say that there’s a small chance one’s work will just sit unused or be outright rejected for even relatively minor changes like adding relative path support to resource cache loading (which does not break existing functionality, and could be made to not alter existing APIs as well).</p>
<p>Certainly, I don’t think your questions are unreasonable, but at the same time how is answering them going to help solve anything?</p>
<p>That aside, here’s another set of answers specifically for the containers question</p>
<ol>
<li>Replace existing Urho containers with EASTL containers. These provide the same guarantee as Urho’s container about consistent cross-platform behavior and size, can also be configured to assert instead of throwing exceptions, and can be modified/extended for Urho as a single set of code as opposed to the highly platform-specific code of the STL. In addition, they add additional types of containers Urho does not have out of the box (and that few are likely willing to reinvent just so Urho can have one as well given the many opensource ones available that would save said developer’s time). One such example is <code>span</code>, which would allow us to replace (or extend) our current interfaces that are along the lines of <code>T* array, unsigned size</code> to a (hopefully) less error prone form that should also be easier to automate script bindings.</li>
<li>This work has mostly away been completed by Eugene (and possibly others from ***), though I intend to add the span support myself.</li>
<li>HashMap key value pairs will require removing the underscore from <code>first_</code> and <code>second_</code> (or potentially very fat wrappers to reference the old names to the new ones). Other minor changes may be required, but I am unaware of them at this point.</li>
<li>Same as 4 above. I’m still not sure why this question was asked, particularly in this thread.</li>
<li>At least one of Urho’s containers is subtly broken in a way not covered by the documentation but only mentioned in some GitHub issues. PODVector cannot safely Push a value from itself into itself, i.e. <code>PODVector&lt;int&gt; v{1,2,3}; v.Push(v.Front());</code> is unsafe and can corrupt the heap, in this case a very difficult to track down bug since it doesn’t always happen (only when the vector just be resized) and it will simply write a little past the end of the array, so likely no segmentation fault). Likely this bug has existed for years in Urho without anyone noticing until relatively recently. Rather than having to find and fix these bugs ourselves, we can use the work of others and focus on the important issues in the engine like graphics and such, rather than spending hours on yet another implemention of a Vector in c++. Beyond this, we gain many types of containers Urho has no implementation of which, while not a great benefit, is nice to be able to use a single library’s containers rather than mixing and matching Urho’s and another libraries.</li>

</aside>
<p>Have Urho ever had clear plan, schedule and task allocation in the past?<br/>
Don’t really remember it.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Maybe I will be obvious here, but I think I understand the core of the argument.<br/>
It is about prioritizing. Preservation before development or development before preservation.</p>
<p>One thinks we should keep what we have first, because otherwise we will harm and chase away exising users.</p>
<p>Another thinks we should develop even if it means reasonable losses in functionality and/or compatibility, because it is pointless to preserve something outdated and outmatched (it’s not about Urho as a whole, but about certain aspects of it).</p>
<p>First group considers this event as an attempt to enforce *** politics onto Urho without care about existing users.<br/>
Second group considers this event as an attempt to break stagnation of the engine they like and use.</p>
<p>aaa: Why do you have to break code that works?<br/>
bbb: Why don’t you stay on stable version if you are fine with current state of things?<br/>
aaa: Why don’t <em>you</em> just move to fork and change it as you wish?<br/>
bbb: Why don’t <em>you</em> move to fork and keep it unchanged?</p>
<p>As you can see, this argument is very symmetric and very subjective, so I won’t comment it in any way.</p>

<p>Thank you for elaborate answer.</p>
<p>I do have certain plans that partially cover your items, but I’m not sure about implementation details. It’s always risky and hard to make changes in Urho renderer.</p>
<p>I’m the type who prefer talking about something after it’s done, not before or in-progress. For example, I’ve posted my lightmap/GI solution the moment I considered it finished and ready to use, not incomplete prototype for show.</p>
<p>I have several ideas how to change renderer, but I will not make any plans or promises until I confirm they will work out well.<br/>
I want to try one radical approach, but it will require huge commitment of effort and therefore you will not get any updates in the nearest months about it.</p>

<p>You see, I’m not willing to deal with AngelScript bindings.<br/>
They may be nice for user, but they are a hindrance for ones who want to make wide-scope changes.<br/>
And Urho cannot abandon AS, since about 1/3 of people here (or so I think, according to poll) really want AS.</p>
<p>If you want to get EASTL in Urho, you probably better ask people who are ready to deal with AS whether they want to do such PRs, not me.</p>
<p>Maybe I will eventually try to do such PR, even if it means working with AS, but I’m totally not in the mood to do it now, not after reaction I got. If so many people are reluctant to accept just EASTL, why would I push?.. I still somewhat want to try PR EASTL into Urho, but it’s very low priority task for me.</p>

<p>From a technical “all options on the table” standpoint, this statement is <em>false</em>.  Code that does EASTL could be merged, if it leaves AS mechanisms <em>alone</em>.  2 different ways would have to be supported, for quite some time.  “Merge” doesn’t mean “I take over with my way, you have to lose <em>your</em> way.”  Migration strategies, in general, do not have to be all-or-nothing propositions.  They <em>can</em> require end users to make choices, like what feature set they’re going to utilize, and making people rewrite some code if they want to migrate.  Providing multiple options <em>does</em> increase complexity and work, especially for test coverage.  In software engineering, that is generally the cost of keeping working code working.</p>
<p>From a <em>personal energy</em> standpoint, it is of course true that you will work on, whatever you actually want to work on.  If you don’t have the software engineering appetite for doing a long term incremental migration to EASTL, and really only would ever choose to implement a simpler, all-or-nothing, disruptive approach, that’s your choice.</p>
<p>I just hope we’re all clear on what is <em>possible</em>.  The tradeoff is <em>work</em>.</p>
<p>People look at any given *** “feature” or “offer” in exactly the same way.  What people will actually do, depends on what people think is important to actually build towards.</p>

<p>Yes.  You clearly think like a bog standard 3d optimization jock, not a project manager concerned with multiple generations of user support.  You wouldn’t believe the amount of stuff that exists in CMake to support backwards compatibility for build systems.  You dismiss engineering solutions that are obvious to other people in the computer industry because they are <em>not perfect, speed of light code</em>.  Get over that, and you can actually solve the political issue with Urho3D and *** development.  <em>If</em> you want to.</p>
<p>The problem is you like EASTL in the 1st place because you believe in speed of light code and don’t want to ever compromise.</p>
<p>Here is your political framework at the build system level:<br/>
USE_URHO_CONTAINER - no new code<br/>
USE_EASTL_CONTAINER - only new EASTL code, breaks AS and anything else in your way.<br/>
USE_BOTH_CONTAINER = USE_URHO_CONTAINER &amp; USE_EASTL_CONTAINER - the most difficult mode that makes both work simultaneously.  <em>It can sacrifice some performance.</em></p>
<p>Your political goal is to get people to move between the 3 categories.  Until such a time most people don’t value the old stuff anymore and it can be gotten rid of.  That will be years from now.</p>

<p>Great.<br/>
So, user had his nice function in the engine API that returned <code>String</code> by reference and has literally zero cost.<br/>
User used this function a lot in the hotpath.<br/>
Then we do migration, and now this function always return copy of <code>String</code> because there is no more <code>String</code> because underlying container was migrated to <code>ea::string</code>.<br/>
This may literally nuke whole application performance.<br/>

<p>You asked why.  The answer is you’re basically biased towards your favorite piece of tech, EASTL.  You don’t see the reality of other people wanting their stability.  Like a lot of open source developers, it’s not that important to you.  Nobody’s <em>paying</em> you to make it important, so you don’t look for a win-win solution.</p>
<p>You aren’t thinking in terms of phased migration, either in your own work, or in other people’s work.  Developers can make choices about whether string functions are critical to them.  They can rewrite some code as they migrate, if the new regime is bringing enough benefits in other areas.  To worry about whether USE_BOTH_CONTAINER is suboptimal, is to completely miss the point that it’s a <em>transitional</em> framework.  If people <em>really</em> care about the performance of something, they’re going to either go forwards to the EASTL and no AS approach, or stay back on the USE_URHO_CONTAINER approach.  <em>Your</em> goal <em>should</em> be to get people to migrate forwards.  If you’re serious about transitions, and implementing “depreciations”, like big projects like CMake or OpenGL actually do in the real world.</p>
<p>What do <em>I</em> get out of participating in this discussion?  I’ve been watching Urho3D for a long time.  I know the project leadership and more importantly project <em>cooperation</em> is in trouble.</p>
<p>I’m <em>hoping</em>, that you are clever enough to see what I’m telling you, so that I don’t <em>personally</em> have to show you how to implement EASTL without harming AS.  Because if I have to do that, then you haven’t contributed any development value to me.  In fact it would pull me deep into the weeds for an issue I’m <em>not</em> that vested in, “what the perfect container class is, and how that can contribute to other *** migrations”.  But I’ve been around the block in Open Source often enough to know what the technical and political dimensions of the problem are.  It’s a shame to see a concept fail, for lack of know-how.</p>
<p>I <em>can</em> help you with the CMake build system end of the problem.  I don’t care what Weitjong has cooked up, I’m quite sure I can implement whatever he thinks is The Right Way To Do It.</p>
<p>The real question, to me, is whether you actually want to change the DNA of Urho3D over time, <em>or</em> you just want to do everything your way because that’s easy for you.  It’s not easy for everyone else which is why such generous offers in open source are respectfully declined.  Making everyone happy is <em>work</em>.  A price must be paid somewhere, either in designing interfaces, or performance, or multiple transitional steps over time.  A user might ultimately have to write 3 versions of code to make a final transition to your new regime.  If they can do that <em>gradually</em>, and keep things working without suffering <em>too much</em> performance loss to get there, it’s a win.</p>

Even if someone were to make a PR in which support were added for both EASTL and the Urho containers, presumably through a large number of <code>#ifdef</code>'s, I would actually recommend against accepting that into the Urho codebase. It seems pointless to me to have twice the number of functions (and five+ times the number of lines) in header files alone for <em>everything</em> that uses a container. Simplicity is a good thing, and this seems like trying to make many times the present work that would be required simply for the sake of people not having to refactor their code to use <code>first</code> instead of <code>first_</code>.</p>

</aside>
<p>Personally, I think this is only sometimes true. Certainly, it could be (dividing breaking changes into minor refactoring sessions seems like a pretty decent approach, overall), but what if, following your own setup, it’s something like user has to spend 1 hour refactoring now vs half an hour every few months. I think then the win is actually with just getting it over with quickly - here’s where you were, here’s a clear list of instructions for how to port to the new containers, it should take an hour or two, have at it (rather than dragging it out marking features as deprecated and removing them slowly piece by piece (so user’s code ends up broken several times over rather than once).</p>
<p>Also, others may disagree, but I don’t see how doing many times the work so others can make all the same changes (just later rather than sooner) is a win for Eugene. It’s a win-win for the paid developers <em>because</em> they get paid to make the other people win, but I don’t really see how Eugene wins in this situation (nor, for that matter, how we add the community win other than that someone is volunteering their effort to bring an improved container library to Urho)</p>
<p>That’s not too say I don’t agree with some of your ideas. By all means, let’s go for a gradual transition, provided it’s only going to be a bit more work and not like ten times as much. I would like some clarification as to how you think cmake solves the problem, though - wouldn’t that literally just be adding a cmake option that adds a preprocessor define? (Which, speaking from personal experience, is really straightforward with our build system - just copying the existing cmake code and changing some names). Perhaps I’m just missing something, though. I have very limited knowledge of cmake.</p>

</aside>
<p><span class="mention">@Eugene</span>, do you know what features are missing from these? If it’s not too many (i.e. unless that actually makes the classes useless) I say we add an anonymous union to Pair&lt;&gt; between first and first_, etc., and mark the underscore variant as deprecated, as well as all the other functions not supported by the adapters. Then in a few months from now, or perhaps with version 2.0, we actually switch to early EASTL (as long as someone deals with the AngelScript bindings). Thoughts?</p>

<p>I believe open source is about <em>one’s will</em>, and not about squabbling with any developer over the details.  Like whether something is “advised” or not, or will be “more work for someone”.  People who <em>want</em> something to happen, go make it happen.  Then others follow in their wake, because they <em>actually did the work, and it works.</em>  That is how open source projects actually get changed.  It may not be Open Source 101, but it’s no more than a 300 level course in What Is To Be Done.</p>

<p>When viewing the *** repository, I am increasingly convinced that switching to EASTL containers is simply a change for changes. There is nothing ideal in them and they have to be supplemented with the necessary functionality. In theory, we probably get some kind of speed increase (which is debatable, since no one checked the difference in real projects) and get an ugly syntax that stands out from the general style. Just as it is necessary to add functionality to EASTL, we can fix / modify / improve Urho3D containers.</p>

<p>You have just admitted that you cannot properly utilize C++ standard library.<br/>
Because a person who regularly uses C++ to full extent cannot <em>not</em> complain about non-standard container library missing features.</p>
<p>For example, if you are good C developer and used to write code this way, you will see no benefit in migration from C++98 to C++11. They will both look the same for you. However, for a person who used to use C++11, such migration will be critical, because on C++98 they will feel crippled.</p>
<p>Same for Urho containers. If you learned 5% of standard library and that’s enough for you, Urho Containers will be fine for you too. If a person learned 90% of standard library, Urho containers are quite annoying to use.</p>

<p>The simplest example is removing heap allocations on hotpaths. This is simplest optimization that can make things several times faster. In EASTL you can change one line and get rid of heap allocation, without changing behavior of the rest of the code. Then you can measure if it’s beneficial or not.<br/>

<p>I agree it looks more nasty. However, these functions specifically have quite limited usage. Have you ever needed to use them? I haven’t. You need to call them once in text renderer, and that’s it. They also have more generic signatures, than functions in Urho containers.<br/>

<p>So far, I don’t value anything that *** is offering.  You personally are not offering any exceptional code merging skills.  I don’t personally value C# in any way.  Although I don’t use AS, I don’t want to see it undermined.  Whatever working ecology Urho3D has, needs to be kept.  Of the issues that have been discussed, I find the archaic tolua++ to be interesting and will be looking into that.  I don’t believe in PBR, I’m using crufty 11 year old business class laptops with minimal DirectX 10.1 HW feature sets.  Gameplay is king for me, and what I actually want out of a game engine, is stuff that allows me to rapidly prototype games.  I don’t believe in 3d modeling and animation packages, not even Blender.  As a lone wolf indie I’m not going to waste my time on producing “shiny” PBR art assets.</p>
<p>In saying anything at all, I was probing your willingness to provide stuff of value to others.  You’re not seeing the kind of merge framework, necessary to make you happy and others happy.  Maybe in coming months, if I actually go with Urho3D, I’ll write the build / merge framework and just tell you one day “here it is”.

<p>Probably a lot, since I’m in the beginning of this path.<br/>
And that’s why your position is so surprising for me.</p>
<p>You are valuing smooth transition thru depreciation above everything else and I understand why this is important.<br/>
I don’t understand why you ignore the rest of aspects.</p>
<p>There is compatibility, so users from old version can smoothly transit to the new one.<br/>
There is code quality, so we can keep core code clean and simple.<br/>
There is real-time performance, so we don’t turn Urho into yet another bloatware.</p>
<p>Sometimes you cannot get all these things together. And sometimes it’s better to sacrifice compatibility than to ruin code quality or performance.</p>
<p>Big projects undergo breaking changes from time to time. That’s why we have versions, you know?</p>
<p>And I agree with you that *** has almost nothing to offer… now.<br/>
I’m just afraid that if this change at some point, it will be too late to merge features back into Urho.</p>

<p>What these many threads have taught me, is that Urho3D is sufficiently far along in maturity and developer energies pulling in different ways, that a framework for getting people to cooperate is <em>necessary</em>.  It can’t just be “well my version wins now”.  Without a framework for What Is To Be Done, at this <em>scale</em> of development, the kind of long thread “I wanna contribute but I can’t, because, Reasons” conversation will repeat <em>indefinitely</em>.  Project won’t be able to absorb new blood, project will die.</p>
<p>It could be that lack of leadership, makes the stress on the cooperative aspect, much more obvious.</p>
<p>I’ve evaluated a fair number of open source 3D engines.  If anyone out there had the feature set I wanted, I’d be using it.  Ogre was stagnant for a long time.  Can’t remember this past year, but don’t remember being interested.  I’m not doing Godot’s GDScript.  It’s also more 2D and mobile oriented than 3D oriented.  Urho3D at least has a sane Lua basis, whatever its other problems.  There’s this guy who wrote Wicked Engine, which has the benefit (to me) of being DirectX oriented and not bothering with non-Windows platforms so much.  But he’s 1 guy and he’s a PBR jock kind of guy.  He’s not going to produce the prototyping development stuff I need, and I bet you trying to add features to some 1 guy’s project, is going to be “stepping on his baby”.  Urho3D’s current lack of leadership is actually an advantage in that regard.  If I did something substantial, nobody would be likely to stop me.</p>
<p>Not doing Rust either.  I have investigated <em>so</em> many programming languages.  I hope Jonathan Blow ships his Jai language soon.  I hear a few people are testing early betas.</p>

<p>Can you explain how Urho API should look like with Urho containers only, EASTL containers only, and both?<br/>
I keep asking this question, but you keep evading it.<br/>
And I don’t say you need to actually write code and implementation anything.</p>
<p>Migration to EASTL is code task first and foremost. Any proposal you make is completely worthless unless it considers actual code we are working with.</p>
<p>So far I believe that it is impossible to have such build switch without impacting performance and drastic decrease in code quality, and I’m not talking about transition state only. Am I wrong? You cannot imagine how happy I will be if I am.</p>
<p>Just one simple example. Node::GetChildren(). How shall it look like?<br/>
This is one-line function, as simple as possible. Can you implement your proposal for just one line of code, so we can understand? If your proposal is doable, it shouldn’t be hard.</p>

<p>No, no, a thousand times no.  You don’t get what <em>in the weeds</em> means.  The problem is, this is the only level of development you’re willing to think about.  Because it’s tangible.  What you’d <em>really</em> have to do to solve the problem, is get into the code for a <em>month</em> and find the answer.  By iterating and changing and testing over and over again, until you have the design.  You don’t have the design now, <em>I</em> don’t have the design now.  You ask me to pop the design off the top of my head, and I keep telling you, sorry it doesn’t work that way.  I talk about <em>personal will</em> and you don’t want to hear that.  You have to be willing to <em>pour the blood on the table</em> to find the right answer.  That’s the only way this sort of non-trivial problem gets solved.</p>

<p>Your <em>huge</em> blind spot is you imagine solutions must be both <em>permanent</em> and <em>performant</em>.  Discard those constraints and you have options.</p>
<p>That’s why I keep talking about <em>the metaphor</em> of USE_BOTH_CONTAINER.  If you actually get into the problem, you won’t actually be able to implement a global switch like that.  You’ll have to phase in whatever particular chunks of engine code you run into.  You could end up with 5 build switches for all I know, phasing different things in.  You’d have to test every phase you implement, verifying the progress, not breaking anything.</p>
<p>It’ll be <em>work</em>.  People can get paid big bucks per hour for this sort of work.  I did it for Mozilla once.  Sadly I blew the project, but I did get paid at least.  I think my “temporary scaffolding” method was actually working, and if I’d only bid the project as 2X more expensive and time consuming, I may have prevailed.  But, the budgeted time and money ran out, and I didn’t have it working.  So that’s that, haven’t done substantial CMake or gotten paid for anything since.  Lessons learned.</p>
<p>Let’s pretend this debate and your question was a consulting contract.  Like you’re the “client”.  This is the point at which I’d be saying, <em>for $X up front</em>, I do a study for you.  Because I know it’s going to be <em>at least</em> 20 hours of work, to tell you the kinds of exact things you want to hear.</p>
<p>This is open source, so of course I don’t do that.  But I don’t waste my 20 hours on <em>your need for specificity</em> either.  If <em>I</em> have to tackle the problem, you’ll get it <em>six months</em> from now and I <em>won’t</em> talk to you about how to do it.  I’ll just say “here it is.”</p>
<p>My 20 hours is going to get blown on tolua++.</p>

<p>You miss the point that I <em>have</em> already spent significant time doing exactly what are you talking about.<br/>
I made two attempts to migrate Urho to EASTL smoothly in past years.<br/>
I actually worked on design for some time, and only after that I came to conclusion that completely smooth transition is impossible.<br/>
Feature branch may be incremental, but the merge should be all at once and it will introduce non functional incompatibilities.</p>
<p>When a person who spent 0 hours on design tells a person who spent 40 hours on design that there is better design without suggesting anything specific… It annoys me, even if you end up being right.</p>

<p>I don’t expect to get free performance just by replacing custom and simple Urho containers with significantly more complicated EASTL containers. This is not the point.<br/>
They have almost the same performance (with deviations in both directions), and this is fine for me.</p>

<p>I understand that UrhoContainer gave you programming pain, and that you wish to alleviate it with EASTL.  I’m asking if <strong>anyone anywhere</strong> has ever demonstrated <strong>real performance gain</strong> with EASTL.  Yes I can web search that, but so far I have not.</p>
<p>I get niceness, stability, completeness, outsourcing arguments (if true).  Asking about performance.</p>
<p>Ok finally bothered to search.  <em>Claim</em> in <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/EASTL" rel="nofollow noopener">EASTL repo</a> is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a fairly extensive and robust implementation of such a library and has an emphasis on high performance above all other considerations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The source tree contains a benchmark.</p>
<p>On Reddit I’ve so far found references to <em>very old</em> benchmarks, but that makes me realize <em>modern</em> benchmarks are what’s relevant now.  One opinion from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ck7zjg/static_analysis_of_electronic_arts_open_source/evl3swb/" rel="nofollow noopener">6 months ago</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I actually did this test at a previous company. We were primarily concerned about compile time and run time, and sorry I don’t have the full results from it, but EASTL was never better, and often slightly worse in every dimension.</p>
<p>I imagine this wasn’t always the case (I mean, they must have written it for a reason). But today’s STD libraries have gotten a lot of attention and are somewhat coupled with the compiler they’re written for, so it’s not really a surprise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the next comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the company I’m at we had EASTL available for our clients and it became such a big cost of maintenance that we made those tests to see if it was worth it. The tests basically revealed that equivalent containers were just as fast in our usages. It took a while to convince everyone that we had to remove. The outcome was to upgrade to c++14 (I do not remember why) and a suprising decrease in compilation time, specifically in one of the bigger projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Discussion from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14617433" rel="nofollow noopener">Hackernews 2.5 years ago</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can clone the repo and run the benchmarks yourself. When I last did it it was quite mixed (compared to libc++ on a MBP) - a lot of things were the same or slightly faster in EASTL, occasionally some things were an order of magnitude faster, some things an order of magnitude slower. Those were in what I would consider “edge cases” rather than general usage, for which the two were fairly similar.</p>
<p>As other comments have said though, the main reason it’s used (and the reason I was interested even though I don’t do games) is because the allocation story in the stdlib sucks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above is all I can find on the subject, after straining to sift through Reddit, Hackernews, Gamasutra, <a href="http://Gamedev.net" rel="nofollow noopener">Gamedev.net</a>, and the web generally.  Done with the research now.  I conclude that to know about performance, one must benchmark current computers and platforms.</p>

<p>Good research. One crux of standard libraries has always been performance inconsistency across different platforms. No surprise here, different implementations are different. A lot. At least EASTL performs same across all platforms. Your findings however seem to hint that situation is changing. For example some recent MSVC STL did major work on debug performance. And then there are extra bits provided by EASTL that are not in stdlib. Be that as it may, there is little discussion to be had about whether current containers better than any alternative - they arent.</p>

<p>Nope. Tests are important.<br/>
And tests show that performance impact of containers is negligible, unless scene rendering is CPU-bound. And if scene rendering is CPU-bound, then containers impact is only a fraction of all suboptimal and weird things Urho does in its rendering. Just think about it: I barely have 60 FPS on my 6-cores i7 drawing just 63k boxes.</p>

<p>That’s right, in the debug version of the engine I lose half the FPS due to the only thing - the sorting of batches. Batches are sorted every frame. Do you continue to argue that the performance of the containers is not important?</p>

<p>As far as I know, sorting of batches has nothing to do with container performance. Sorting algo and memory layout of batches determine performance of batch sorting.<br/>
Batch sorting performance is important and is completely unrelated to overall performance of container library. Batch sorting may be slower due to debug iterators, but it’s not the case neither for Urho nor of EASTL containers</p>

<p>The transfer from Urho to *** is already easy. EASTL (or just STL) in Urho would make backward transfer easy too.<br/>
Backward transfer from *** to Urho is low priority for me, that’s why I’m not actually pushing EASTL, only agitating.</p>

<p>Discourse told me 54 new posts!  Wow.  Well I guess that’s from chat style of conversation.  Not criticizing, just surprised at big number.  Feels like payback for “walls of text” write.  So here’s another one.</p>
<p>C++ has the overriding issue of older code, C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20.  The better scripting language binding mechanisms, are requiring higher and higher versions, to achieve elegance and less maintenance work.  For instance, <a href="https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2" rel="nofollow noopener">sol2 3.0</a> uses C++17 features.  There are 2 or 3 other possibly “good” C++ binding regimes available for Lua, I have not worked through their differences.  But which version of C++, is clearly one of the tradeoffs.  Meanwhile in Python land, pybind11 of course requires C++11.  That’s pretty much bare minimum for “dragging people forwards”, going that route.</p>
<p>My research on EASTL vs. STL is that performance has to be checked.  EASTL was for performance a <em>long time ago</em>.  Various STL may be just fine now, <em>particularly</em> if dragging people forwards through C++## versions.</p>
<p>If dragging people through C+++## versions, then “niceness” arguments have to be checked too.  You think EASTL is nice, what if we think STL in C++14 is nice?  I don’t know or have an opinion on that at this time, but I do know, this is the question.  Your EASTL may not be as future looking as you think.</p>
<p>The loops in your TetrahedralMesh code, look like the kinds of things I personally would want to do in something resembling ASM code.  Because I actually think in ASM code, I have trouble committing to Python or Lua.  I’m digging a bit through the Lua universe to understand how people <em>try to</em> use it for performance.  It may not look like sanity from my ASM perspective.  I don’t know if your container approach looks like sanity either.  I understand “niceness” and “get it working” arguments, but it’s a C++ perspective and I don’t like C++.  If I had a <em>better</em> language to offer you, I’d try to convince you to write stuff in <em>that</em>, and forget about this EASTL or STL container stuff.</p>
<p>I am going to look at what Jonathan Blow thinks of LLVM.  I believe he is writing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Blow#JAI_language" rel="nofollow noopener">Jai</a> on top of that.  Using LLVM “as portable assembly” is something other people have done.  However LLVM is a big heavy external dependency, a <em>pile</em> of code.  Historically I did not want to get into it, because I cannot personally maintain LLVM or take it into the future.  But if Blow actually ships Jai in the near future, then getting into LLVM makes more sense to me.  I wouldn’t be “alone” in dealing with it for 3d graphics and game performance issues.</p>
<p>The Lua way of doing this is much more sane by comparison.  You can wrap your head around the standard Lua implementation.  It’s designed to be good at that.  But if the standard Lua 5.4 doesn’t actually <em>do what I want</em>, well it’s a problem.</p>
<p>I suspect that LuaJIT probably does <em>more like</em> what I want, haven’t finished investigating.  But it’s a development dead end.  No leadership, headless.  Clearly, they can’t stay abreast of official Lua, which harms the ecosystem.</p>
<p>PyPy does actually stay abreast of Python, it’s fine that way.  But you have to deal with the GIL, which could be suicide for all this low level manipulation stuff.  Having to even think about the GIL, definitely makes me itch.  I really don’t want to itch.</p>
<p>I don’t think these people write their languages from a 3D programmer’s perspective.  Someone who has to manipulate a lot of vector math in arrays.</p>
<p>I revisited <a href="https://julialang.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Julia</a>, but apparently their JIT is <em>slow</em> to get fired up.  They don’t have any kind of Ahead Of Time compilation, and do not seem to be oriented towards applications development.  Rather, scientific computation batch processing.  Software <em>amateurs</em> fiddling around to get their numeric results.  Nobody developing games touches it.  Get the idea that devs might like their language to be more general purpose and not sitting in its niche, but they aren’t meaningfully executing on that.  Wait <em>more</em> years, see if they moved forwards any, seems to me.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they had 2 C++ binding mechanisms available.  I started to yawn.  Might double check my work sometime.</p>

<p>I would be happy if we could move Urho to standard library.<br/>
Because that’s why standard libraries are created, right? To be used.</p>
<p>My point is that migration to pure STL is significantly harder than migration to augmented EASTL.<br/>
And the lower version of STL you aim, the less benefits will be gained from such migration.</p>
<p>E.g. I like EASTL for spans and string views, but they were standartized only in C++20.<br/>
I <em>think</em> that only C++17 or C++20 <em>allow</em> user to write their own stack-allocating containers, while EASTL has them already implemented.</p>

<p>Well if you insist per previous arguments, that EASTL inclusion <em>has to</em> break existing UrhoContainer, then it isn’t any more of a tempting offer than C++## STL stuff.  From the user’s perspective, breaking stuff is breaking stuff.  It’s churn.</p>
<p>My hope would be that EASTL or one of the C++## STL <em>does not have to</em> break UrhoContainer, that they can live side by side, even if there is some performance loss for doing so.  You say you looked at it, didn’t find any answer, and just want to make some big break.</p>
<p>I haven’t looked at it.  I assume from your failed efforts, “it is a hairy problem”.  Touches all kinds of things.  Will probably not look at it for some time.  I wrap my head around Urho3D and scripting language “theory of operation”.  Seems to be very basic and fundamental question, how people choose to express their vector math in code.</p>
