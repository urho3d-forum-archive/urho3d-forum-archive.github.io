<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I ran into a problem previously. There was a nice tweak to work. I was getting material artifacting if near clip was zero or to low. I left a issue of it at <a  rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1920</a> and <a href="http://imgur.com/a/yyP7q" rel="nofollow noopener">http://imgur.com/a/yyP7q</a></p>
<p>When I set the near clip of the camera to 1.0f it helped solve the problem. Ideally I would like to move the camera for example 1km from a object and still have it show visibly okay.  At minimum a near clip of 0.1f or lower, to 8192km far clip. It might be a little extreme.</p>
<p>Ideally I would like to model objects full scale as 1.0 equal to 1 meter.</p>
<p>Any thoughts or help appreciated. As Iâ€™m not sure what internal Urho3D updates is needed to make that possible.</p>

<p>I heard that reversed depth buffer may solve some depth issues.</p>

<p>The safest way is to use separate scenes (large-scale world and local space).</p>

<p>Far clip affects precision much less that near clip. BTW, far clip may be +Inf</p>
