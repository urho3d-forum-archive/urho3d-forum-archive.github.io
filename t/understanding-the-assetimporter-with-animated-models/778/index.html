<p>Hi,</p>
<p>On the <a data-bbcode="true" href="http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.32/_tools.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.32/_tools.html</a> page i understand that if not importing OGRE models to use AssetImporter.  but i have always had model animations be a part of the 3D model and on that page it says .mdl and .ani ---- if I have a 3D model with several animations ( or even just one animation ) then will the AssetImporter split my 3D model into --&gt; 3Dmodel.mdl 3DmodelAnimation1.ani 3DmodelAnimation2.ani 3DmodelAnimation3.ani etc ?</p>
<p>would the animations be strictly usable only to that specific 3D model or would they work on other 3D models that have the exact same skeleton-rig? ( in my case i’d like to create say 10 characters but all use the same skeleton-rig and all have the same initial t-pose )</p>
<p>Additionally: I have always used 32-bit .png files ( usually with semi-transparent or translucent areas ) in my 3D models but would .dds be better and if so then how to convert my 32-but .png’s to the .dds format to keep Urho3D happy with the final .dds file? ( please note I have never worked with .dds files before )</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">Edit</span></span>: Also would .dds work on Android or would I need 32-bit .png instead?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i">Edit 2:</span></span> before i asked “<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i">and I export it as .FBX ( is .FBX or .MS3D ok to use? )</span></span>” and the answer is here ( i should have looked here first ) <a data-bbcode="true" href="http://assimp.sourceforge.net/main_features_formats.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://assimp.sourceforge.net/main_features_formats.html</a> so currently it doesn’t support FBX but does support MS3D which is ok i guess…</p>

<p>Skinning bone weights are stored in the .mdl. There should not be a problem to use animations in several models that share the same rig, provided that the bone transforms are identical (ie. no repositioning or scaling of bones between models)</p>

<blockquote>

should work yes<br/>
Once these different models must be use the same type of rig.<br/>
Binding to the skeleton model is makeing in your favorite 3D editor (Maya, Blender…)</p>

i suppose what not, i don’t know exactly.<br/>
You need to have native texture format for each platform for better perfomance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>*.png I would use only at the stage of development but not at the stage of release.<br/>
He slows down when loading the game, because of the 3D engine is still trying to keep the texture with the native hardware format as I think.</p>
<p>*.DDS would be preferable to the PC platform. This is a hardware format it is not any additional calculations when loading the game.<br/>
and *.dds also preserve gpu memory bus bandwidth, 'cause it is hardware compression has.</p>
<p>In addition it may contain pre-calculated mipmaps. And If you download the *.png video card again tries to generate them, which takes time.</p>
<p>i’m usually use command line tool - nvdds.exe (from NVDSK TOOLS) + *.bat file for batch convert.<br/>
Aslo you may install plugin for gimp and expors your’s textures one by one from gimp )</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is .FBX or .MS3D ok to use?<br/>
In your place I would have done so.<br/>
save *.fbx -&gt; opened it in the blender -&gt; looked instill is ok with the model? -&gt; And do export through the plug from <span class="mention">@reattiva</span> to the project folder</p>

<p>I am trying to get the AssetImporter compiled on my system right now but it has an ALSA library not found error so as soon as i get that fixed then i’ll try to get some of my .fbx models into Urho3D.  Also I think I’ll start doing my models using dds.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>Got it!  The answer was to go grab the ALSA 1.0.28 “lib” from their site and then install that to my offline PC.  After that cmake/make worked perfectly to compile Urho3D from source.  Now I got the AssetImporter and everything!!  I imported one of my .FBX models in and it’s pretty awesome <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/7014497b1c97c810791a011290bda7f5.png" title=":smiley:"/></p>

You need assign a new material for this part of mesh, and then in Urho3D editor in Material Editor<br/>
<a data-bbcode="true" href="http://savepic.su/4724713.htm"><img alt="" height="" src="../../../images2/0192c2135b6d8d2b5b857dab8cbfa2c9.png" width=""/></a><br/>
choise cull mode, then save material.</p>
