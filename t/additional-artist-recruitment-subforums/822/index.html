<p>Hi,<br/>
the thought of two possible additional subforums has popped up in forum threads &amp; PMs. I’d like to ask all of you, on whether you feel these would be warranted and useful.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Artist forum</span>. Discussion of creating / importing / exporting / troubleshooting art, as it relates to Urho3D. Also sharing of free art if you feel like doing so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Recruitment forum</span>. Similar to SDL Jobs and Ogre Recruitment forum; request help on Urho3D-related projects and/or offer your skills. May include both paid &amp; free work. Naturally any arrangements you negotiate are wholly on your own risk and not the responsibility of the forum admins / Urho3D team.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that neither forum would be meant for circumventing the forum rule of no unsolicited advertising. But you could showcase work where on-topic (eg. you offer yourself as an elite Urho3D shader author on recruitment forum; naturally you can then show your related work)</p>

<p>I think this will be great as it will make certain assets readily available for those who might want to test out ideas  <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/c16ddadcbd525aa6d219a1df596d362f.png" title=":smiley:"/> . But I guess checks and regulations would be put in place to insure that works shared are original and legal, with permissive license.</p>

<p>Yes, that’s an important point to note (though it’s already covered by the general forum rules) Basically if something fishy is posted, whoever notices it needs to notify the mods/admins and we’ll deal with it.</p>

<p>An <span class="bbcode-b">Artist</span> or art subforum would help organize topics, and I anticipated more of those coming.</p>
<p>A <span class="bbcode-b">Recruitment</span> subforum: project and Urho3D developments are mutually beneficial, and this is probably the best place to facilitate that.</p>

<p>Sounds good. I’d suggest those posting recruitment offers to follow a simple title tag format, eg: [PAID], [UNPAID],[DEFERRED], etc. (where profit-share falls into deferred).</p>

<p>The new subforums should be live. I hope I set (copied) the permissions properly, so that you actually can post <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/95940790c23d98635b2a6d3f22657158.png" title=":wink:"/> Thanks to everyone who offered their input!</p>
