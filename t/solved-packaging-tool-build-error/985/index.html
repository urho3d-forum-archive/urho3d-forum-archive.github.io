<p>That combination was known to have caused problem and we should have fixed the problem about 11 days ago. Perhaps you need to recreate your build tree from scratch again. BTW, I have just tested a clean build with these two build options enabled using MinGW compilers both on my Linux host system and Windows7 VM. Both built without encountering any problem.</p>

<p>I have never tried to configure/generate the build tree using cmake-gui on Windows host system before. It is a long shot but can you check the “bin/tool” subdir in your build tree to see whether the PackageTool.exe is indeed being built successfully. And if so, try to execute it without any parameter. If it runs correctly then it should show the usage instruction. If it is not runnable then that is the problem causing RESOURCE_CHECK target to fail. Show the error message here if that is the case. If, however, the PackageTool.exe is not yet built then we have a bug on our hand here. If it is the latter case then you could try to workaround the problem first by calling ‘make PackageTool’ to ensure the tool is being built first then ‘make RESOURCE_CHECK’ then ‘make all’ in that order.</p>
<p>EDIT: At the moment our Urho3D cmake common module only setups rule to look for PackageTool.exe in the “bin/tool”. It will not look for and use PackageTool_d.exe. So, that could be potentially the cause of your problem too.</p>

<p>[quote=“Sinoid”]Weird. MinGW - Windows 7 build works for me with the settings you posted. Note, I didn’t use the cmake gui.</p>
<p>The only “issue” I run into is MinGW freaking out about a circular include path in SpritePacker that it resolves itself.</p>
<p>Does MinGW trigger cmake to update the tree for you? On my machines it doesn’t, so I have to run the batch file every single time I change the config.[/quote]<br/>
Thanks for confirming that it works for you. At least now I know this is an isolated issue.</p>
<p>For me, the CMake is retriggered automatically whenever I change the config or any of the CMakeLists.txt. This is the case for all the host systems that I have worked with. The only time this is not done automatically is, when there are new source files being added in which case I would have to rerun the build script or the ‘rake cmake’ task manually.</p>

<p>In theory it should not make any differences between cmake-gui or cmake CLI (either calling it directly or via one of our convenient build scripts). I would be very interested to see how your “Source/Tools/Urho3DPlayer/CMakeFiles/RESOURCE_CHECK.dir/build.make” is being generated in your build tree.

Check for anything out of place in your version of the generated “build.make”, like incorrect path or extra space in the path without double quotes, etc. In short even if you use one of the provided build scripts but with exactly the same “settings” that you have used before then you would most likely encounter the same problem again, barring the case if indeed it is a cmake-gui bug.</p>

<p>I only spotted one difference that may or may not be relevant to your issue. In your version the package tool is invoked without the .exe extension. I know in Windows command line you can invoke a binary without a .exe extension but I am not sure when it is inside a Makefile build rule.</p>
<p>I also noticed that your CMake version is quite old. I suggest you upgrade to the latest version first and probably your problem would go away. I have been using 3.1.1 on my Win7 VM. It appears that 3.2.1 has been out. I will upgrade to that version soon.</p>
