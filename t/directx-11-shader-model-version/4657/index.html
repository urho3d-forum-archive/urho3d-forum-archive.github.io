<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I noticed that the Urho3D is using Shader Model 4.0 for DirectX 11. Is there any reason not to use Shader Model 5.0?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>None of the SM5 features are available in engine, so all you’re missing from SM5 are intrinsic functions (lightning fast <code>rcp</code> being the most significant one) which are mostly still not present in GLSL which means you can’t use them without writing slow versions for GL (or dumping it).</p>
<p>SM4 will also work on the 10_1 and 10_0 feature levels. If you force SM5 to be used then only DX11 feature levels 11_0 and onward will work.</p>
<p>If you really really want to, it’s a pretty easy change. For GS/HS/DS I just up to SM5 when there’s a Hull+Domain shader involved and otherwise leave it as SM4 … though I still debate the advantages of fast rcp (and a few other DX only niceties), especially with DX10 hardware almost extinct.</p>
<hr/>
<p>TL;DR: you have to go into the renderer guts to get more of the significant gains that come with upping the min feature level than just another shader-model version - ie. structured buffers for instanced skeletal animation (doable but crippled on DX10), etc.</p>

<p>Thank you for your answer!<br/>
I understand the desire to be compatible with as much hardware as possible, but in this case we are talking about cards produced for a couple of years almost 10 years ago. Whoever targets those, can still use DX9 (and even the need to support DX9 is debatable).</p>
