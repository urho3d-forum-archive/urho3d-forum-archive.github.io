<p>Hi, all!</p>
<p>I created CrowdManager and Agent.<br/>
Now I want several agents as parts of different crowd.<br/>
More than that, I want them to migrate from one crowd ot another from time to time.<br/>
How to do this?<br/>
I know DetourCrowd can do this, but how to do this in Urho?</p>
<p>Also, I have various surfaces I want agents to avoid, but walk on last resort (if no other path available).<br/>
Like roads and sidewalks. How could I make so that crowd paths are preferred to be on sidewalk?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Although I recall someone fiddling with multiple crowd support it was never merged. The CrowdAgent asks the scene for a <code>CrowdManager</code> (to create or return). You’ll have to settle on some sort of scene structure and seek upward to find the <code>CrowdManager</code> component you want to use during <code>CrowdAgent::OnSceneSet</code>.</p>

<p>That is dependent on how you implement the above. I have no idea as to what the consequences are. I never looked at whoever’s code that was that gave this a whirl.</p>

<p>You have to use NavAreas for that. Costs are assigned/read through the SetAreaCost/GetAreaCost methods. Beware though that these work with dtQueryFilter, and the filter used for the <code>NavigationMesh</code> is not the same as the one used for the <code>CrowdManager</code>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>In general, when exploring the Detour code NavAreas are the place to begin tracing through as they’re simple to understand and run through most of the really important areas of Detour.</p>

<p>Hi, all!</p>
<p>BTW, is it possible to use CrowdNavigation for traffic simulation instead of crowds?<br/>
Would be interesting to try…</p>

<p>Unless they’ve been broken they should work. You have to place them and then build the navmesh. So if they don’t work be sure to say something.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Sort of, you really wouldn’t want to do it per-agent (more like per-many agents - there’s a cap on how many filters), but the <code>CrowdAgent::SetQueryFilterType</code> and  everything in <code>CrowdManager</code> containing the text “queryfilter” deal with that, including exclusion from area-types.</p>
