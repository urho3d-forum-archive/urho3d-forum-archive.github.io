<p>Disclaimer: I am aware of the fact that this question was already asked on the forum, but I have a different, strict case, description of which I could not find anywhere on the Internet.</p>
<p>I am currently working on a project, where my game’s logic is being provided after the actual core engine/editor is already compiled (Long story short: I am using Urho as a library in order to provide JIT C++ mod support), and because of that, there is no way for me to actually register anything afterward in a code form. As far as I am aware, the editor does not REALLY need the class implementation, since it simply assigns component names to nodes, and allows to edit their attributes. When I was working with Source engine, they used a technique with a declaration of the class name, and its attributes in a separate text file, which the engine afterward used to supply logic for by providing backend C++ implementation. Could anybody help me out with this one? I am currently using variable editor per node in my prefabs in order to emulate this behavior, but I would really like to provide a better editor experience to modders of the game.</p>
<p>Edit: My current solution is going to be a compilation of core game/mods into a separate library, then linking that library to UrhoPlayer and compiling it in order to provide all the necessary codebase/registrations that would be needed by the editor to use components properly.</p>

<p>If the goal is providing a better modding experience, you may want a more project-specific editor.<br/>
Like those that came with the Blizzard RTS games I played.</p>
<p>Making something that does less can be easier for both developer and user.</p>

<p><a href="https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/blender-2-8-exporter-with-additonal-features-e-g-urho3d-materialnodes-and-components/5240">Dertom’s Blender Exporter</a> presents a nice Blender node interface to components, using a text resource (json) produced by <code>Urho3D-Blender-Runtime</code> and specifically <a href="https://github.com/dertom95/urho3d-blender-runtime/blob/master/src/tools/SceneLoader/LoaderTools/ComponentExporter.cpp">Urho3DNodeTreeExporter</a> which can be adapted for custom controls. In this way, the Model component even improves on Urho’s: with automatic mesh selection it can be assigned without changes to any number of objects.<br/>
Being able to assign multiple trees to objects allows for modular design with components sharing common properties: standard CollisionShapes, RigidBody with some standard properties, etc.</p>
