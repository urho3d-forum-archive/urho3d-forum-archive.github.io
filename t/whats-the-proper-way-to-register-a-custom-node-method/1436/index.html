<p>Hi i tried to register some of my nodes’ functions but when i try to call them from the script the game crashes :</p>
<p>I register it like this : (The INFPlayer is a derived class from INFNode which is derived from Urho3d::Node)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>After this i register a global function called getCurrentPlayer() which returns an INFPlayer pointer</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>But whenever i try to call this function from the script the game crashes.I’m pretty sure i’m missing something… So whats the proper way of registering a custom Node ?</p>
<p>If i register Urho3d::Application static functions it works fine , the crash happens only with Nodes</p>

<p>You should not subclass Node, but just create new components. Subclassing Node will bite you in the ass when you try to load/save or network synchronize the scene and it doesn’t know to create the custom nodes on the opposite side.</p>

<p>Hi Cadaver ! And thanks for the quick reply ! I have my own save/load mechanism so i wont use those , neither the networking part .The game has an extremely large level(s) so i can’t load it at once , therefore i split them into segment chunks.<br/>
The point of subclassing the Node is simply having a “Recursive” access to the scene graph structure.This works very well so far , and i have really clean code thanks to this.</p>
<p>e.g a simple call to a someSegment-&gt;build() builds the segment.All child nodes in the segment will call their build() functions recirsively and do their job.</p>
<p>Using components would really mess things up since they are not recursive , so i would need to code some kind of a Component Graph to have a component child parent structure to keep track of the whole scene structure.Not to mention is still need Nodes in the scene to use these components</p>
<p>I still can expose some global functions from my Urho3d::Application and use those if Custom Node registration is not possible , but it would be really useful<br/>
Thanks</p>
<p>EDIT Don’t get me wrong i found the Component system very useful in lot of situations ! Like a MuzzleFlash component or a CharacterController component ! Makes c++ as you write scripts  <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/ab33f6c546ca85e7d84a4e3c32cd4034.png" title=":slight_smile:"/> it’s very convenient ! but in this situation i would rather go with subclassing (if possible ofcourse)</p>

<p>Also, you’re downstream from RefCounted in inheritance so you should be using the autohandle registration syntax.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for the help ! It works perfectly now .</p>
