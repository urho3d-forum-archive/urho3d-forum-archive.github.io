<p>Hey guys,<br/>
I’m using AnimationController on a Zombie model, which works great for Looping animations.<br/>
Today I implemented Attack animations, where Looping is False.<br/>
I subscribe to E_ANIMATIONFINISHED in order to receive notification that we’ve reached the end of a non-looping animation, and in the handler for that event, I Unsubscribe from it.<br/>
All good so far, except that after a few attacks, my Zombie fails to receive that important event, and so it just stands there looking stupidly at my player.<br/>
I can trigger further attacks by moving the player away from the zombie, but what I really would like to know, is why my code is not reliably receiving the event in question!</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">        }else
        {
            if(okToAttack_)
            {
                /// Choose a random attack
                int rand=Rand();
                float frand = (float)rand / 32768.0f;
                frand *=3; // zombies have three attacks
                int irand = (int)frand;

                /// Play attack animation - looping is FALSE
                animCtrl-&gt;PlayExclusive(Animations_[Animations_Zombie::Z_Attack + irand].Name, 0, false, 0.2f);
                /// During attack, it is not ok to attack again
                okToAttack_=false;
                /// We need to be notified when the attack animation has finished
                SubscribeToEvent( GetNode()-&gt;GetChild("Adjustment"), E_ANIMATIONFINISHED, URHO3D_HANDLER(Character, HandleAnimationFinished));

            }
        }
    }

}

void Character::HandleAnimationFinished(StringHash eventType, VariantMap&amp; eventData){
    /// Attack animation has finished - we can stop listening for this event
    UnsubscribeFromEvent(GetNode()-&gt;GetChild("Adjustment"), E_ANIMATIONFINISHED);
    /// Zombie is now free to attack again
    okToAttack_=true;
}</code></pre>
<p>EDIT:<br/>
I have discovered that this bug only occurs when the same non-looping animation is executed twice in a row. AnimationController thinks it has already sent the event once, and so never sends it again, unless a different animation is played. Sure I could keep track of which attack was used last and make sure never to use the same attack twice in a row, and that’s fine for my zombie, but it’s a big problem for my player character, we have to assume that the player will repeatedly apply the same attack, so short of monitoring the state of the non-looping animation, I’m out of luck! Has anyone else run into this issue? What was your workaround?<br/>
Calling Stop on the previously-played animation did not fix it, the only thing that has worked for me is calling SetTime on the previous animation, and passing in zero as the time.</p>

<p>Yeah man, the Stop method needs to call SetTime(0) for starters</p>
<p>It would be unfair of me to complain, tell you I found a way to fix the issue, and not post code.<br/>
Here is my workaround, which assumes that we keep track of the previous non looping animation we played.</p>

        {
            if(okToAttack_)

                /// Set time of previous animation to zero to prevent bug in playing same animation twice
                animCtrl-&gt;SetTime( Animations_[AttackAnimationIndex].Name,0);

                /// Choose a random attack
                int rand=Rand();
                float frand = (float)rand / 32768.0f;
                frand *=3; // zombies have three attacks
                int irand = (int)frand;
                AttackAnimationIndex = Animations_Zombie::Z_Attack + irand;

                /// Play attack animation - looping is FALSE
                animCtrl-&gt;PlayExclusive(Animations_[AttackAnimationIndex].Name, 0, false, 0.2f);
                /// During attack, it is not ok to attack again
                okToAttack_=false;
                /// We need to be notified when the attack animation has finished
                SubscribeToEvent( GetNode()-&gt;GetChild("Adjustment"), E_ANIMATIONFINISHED, URHO3D_HANDLER(Character, HandleAnimationFinished));
            }

<p>And I said that calling Stop did not resolve the issue of playing a non looping animation twice in a row, but only getting the animation event once - I was quite clear about this - the documentation did not help me - the only thing that did help was manually setting the time to zero, on an animation state that had already finished playing! When I do something consistent, like sign up to receive event X, I expect to receive event X - not just once, but consistently - given that non looping animations do not stop themselves, I needed to receive notification that the animation had finished - I accept that it is a corner case to play the same animation twice, but I believe it to be a very common case as well, and was surprised that the issue appears to have gone unnoticed for all this time.</p>

<p>I’m not looking for a fight, but I would like to contribute anything I learn to the documentation, and this is currently an issue - doxygen only includes footnotes left in the sourcecode, and there are gaps in the learning of this engine that remain unfilled, unless you happen to be quite good at poking around in the master sourcecode. I would contribute my findings to a FAQ, but we have none. You’re left to scour the forum for help, and cross your fingers for luck.</p>

<p>Well, I would disagree to dismiss all the documentation work done by Lasse as “footnotes”. The bulk of the text in the online doc are actually manually authored by Lasse initially in separate files (but using Doxygen format). Granted it could be better but no one is complaining so far. The source code is the best documentation available in the project. Aside from the Doxygen style documentation for the classes and methods, the code are so well commented and clearly written, I don’t need to graduate from a computer science to understand them. That’s what attracted me to the project long time ago. One should manage their expectation. Urho3D Project is a non-profit organization without any sponsors to date. If you want to contribute, please do contribute. Don’t need to find any excuses.</p>
