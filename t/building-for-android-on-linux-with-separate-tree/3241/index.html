<p>Hi, all!</p>
<p>How can I build for Android <strong><em>on Linux host</em></strong> when I have separate tree for my project?</p>
<p>i.e. I build Urho for Android as static library.<br/>
How can I build my project for Android? Are instruction are the same as for normal Linux build,<br/>
or there are differencies? How to make .apk with my project after this?<br/>
(yes, I tried searching the forum, but it seems my use case is unpopular)<br/>
(no, I’m not noob, I just not experienced developer <strong><em>for</em></strong> Android, while porting Android to various devices<br/>
is a part of my $$$ job, i.e. I extremely rarely do apps, I work with core system and frameworks)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Also, as my device is “rooted” (actually never was “unrooted”), is it possible to just put files on device and edit them there to save<br/>
on deployment during development? As I prototype using AngelScript, sometimes I want to check<br/>
if that will be good for Android or not…</p>

<p>Our build process is largely the same for different build/host system. Contrary to your view, Linux is a first class citizen as a build/host system as well as target platform. In fact it may work better than the rest simply because all our CI are tested on Ubuntu VM.</p>
<p>As for your problem, I don’t see it in your post. Please try it first by following our online documentation page and report back exactly where you have failed.</p>
