<p>I’ve copied CMake/Modules to the root folder and added the code to CMakeLists.txt exactly as shown there, but when I try to configure the project through cmake-gui I receive this error:</p>
<blockquote>

Could NOT find compatible Urho3D library in Urho3D SDK installation or<br/>

<p>I have already set URHO3D_HOME inside cmake_gui pointing to the Urho3D folder (inside Dependencies/Urho3D), but it keeps complaining that can’t find the library or SDK installation. What am I missing here?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hi Eugene, thanks for the reply. I’ve read that linked topic yesterday and it says</p>

<p>In the mean time though, unless you are familiar with how CMake works, I advice to stay within the currently supported use case as documented in the <a href="https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_using_library.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_using_library.html</a> in order not to waste your time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since I was following the “currently supported use case”, I thought this method was actually working and that it was my fault in messing it up… so there’s no way of making it work for now? <img alt=":disappointed:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/e0aea55cf787015b4b0fb1008b2f2441.png" title=":disappointed:"/></p>

<p>Sorry, I misunderstood the topic because you actually don’t need to <em>submodule</em> Urho despite the title.<br/>
Then…</p>
<p>Make sure that URHO3D_HOME is set to <em>built</em> CMake project, you shan’t set the variable to Urho’s sources. However, in this case you don’t need (or even mustn’t) store Urho inside your project)</p>

<p>Ok, I guess I’ve got it… The scenario described is one of adding a dependency to the SDK, this is why there’s no need to submodule it.</p>
<p>Well, I guess there’s nothing that could be done for now. I will build Urho3D inside its own folder and maybe think about a workaround in the future.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Sorry for the delay. Personally I have not given that issue enough priority. I intentionally discourage the submodule usage with the current state of our build system to casual CMake users. However, if you are a CMake expert then that advise doesn’t apply to you. And you are welcome to submit a PR to contribute your changes if you have cracked it yourself.</p>

<p>Hi weitjong, thanks for the reply. It is my intention fixing it so it works as a submodule, but right now my priority is finishing my Master’s project, which is using Urho3D as its main dependency. Anyway, I guess I’ll keep studying Urho’s CMake code in my spare time during the Master’s, let’s see if I’ll be able to crack it in the meantime. <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/ab33f6c546ca85e7d84a4e3c32cd4034.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>
