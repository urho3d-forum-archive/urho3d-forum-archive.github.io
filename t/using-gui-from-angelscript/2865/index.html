<p>Hi, all!</p>
<p>While struggling with GUI system I found several  major problems I’m unable to solve for very long time.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In windowed mode, when window is controlled by window manager in X11<br/>
I try to put simple menu (out of default buttons) in the center. For some strange reason, regardless of window<br/>
size I see resolution reported to be 1024x768, so menu is offset and not really adequate. There’s no such<br/>
problem with full screen, but I need windowed mode to be working right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In many cases I want widgets to be automatically placed on screen. I know how to do it by hand,<br/>
but is it possible to set some default for some container so everything there is autoplaced?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Adding items to container dynamically, containers often break and display items one over another.<br/>
It doesn’t happen when I just set up them once via xml.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can’t make drop-down list work. Whatever I try I can’t see any items inside. I know it works in editor,<br/>
but when I copy-paste it breaks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I try this all with AngelScript.</p>
<p>Also I have additional question - is it possible to create custom widget using AnglScript? Most<br/>
important widget I need it a button, and i can represent everything with buttons and windows,<br/>
except for input boxes (which work too, so no problem here) but I’d like to have some changes on layout and<br/>
style (I don’t need this GUI-system look, just clickable pic is fine), but I need widget-relative coordinates<br/>
from mouse clicks, is it possible to implement with AngelScript-only?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
