<p>Hello, I have a 3D character loaded to urho3D and I am able to access each bone node of the 3D character and set them in different postures by applying rotations. Also I have a floor plane loaded as a static model and character is placed on the floor. Now when I try to make my character in sitting on a chair posture, feet are not in contact with the floor and it looks unnatural (refer image).</p>
<p><a href="http://prnt.sc/ehzibw" rel="nofollow noopener">http://prnt.sc/ehzibw</a></p>
<p>Is there way to get character in expected view? I am not looking into use AnimationController since I want to have different postures like sitting on the ground, squatting and etc by applying quaternion rotation for bones. In simply, I want to keep the character in contact with the floor despite of it’s posture. Reference to any feature sample which has implemented this would be great.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<ol>
<li>Place ass bone (root?) on chair</li>
<li>Use IK for place feet on ground (look for Inverse Kinematics on forum)</li>

<p>Well, looking for inverse kinematics on this forum might be too far fetched,<br/>
as AFAIK there were no working feet IK published (at least not with recent version of Urho).<br/>
Hope somebody could update or explain how it works.</p>

Thank you for your answer, I’ll check on IK.</p>

Yeah I went through the same and yeah it would be great to see working example of IK in Urho.</p>
