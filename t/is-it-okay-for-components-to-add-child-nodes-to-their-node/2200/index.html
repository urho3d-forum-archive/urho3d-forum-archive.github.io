<p>I’m still trying to make an optimal hierarchy for my scene, but can’t fully solve one issue.<br/>
I want to create content via code and do not want to use the XML editor for this yet, as 90% of my game objects are dynamically generated walls and floors.</p>
<p>Let’s say I have a node which <span class="bbcode-b">requires</span> two child models:</p>
<ul>
<li>a grid which can be moved up and down (e.g. a static model)</li>
<li>Another pointer model placed on that grid (with a Raytrace).<br/>
Thus the node is basically the cursor in 3D space for an in-game editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without those models, the whole node doesn’t make any sense. It must have those child models and nodes hosting them. Those models also don’t make sense anywhere else.</p>
<p>So I thought of a script component on the cursor node to just create the children:<br/>
[ul][li]CursorNode</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CursorComponent (Component)<br/>
[list][<em>]GridNode (created by CursorComponent)<br/>
GridModel (StaticModel, created by CursorComponent) [/li]<br/>
[li]PointerNode (created by CursorComponent)<br/>
PointerModel (StaticModel, created by CursorComponent)[/li][/ul][/</em>:m][/list:u]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is that good code design? Or are there better design choices I should take here?</p>

<p>I often have components add child nodes and other components, and find OnNodeSet() convenient for initializing (for deserializing however, see how VehicleDemo does that):</p>
<p><code>void Cursor3D::OnNodeSet(Node* node) {
  if (!node) { // removed from node
    return; }
  SubscribeToEvent(E_UPDATE, URHO3D_HANDLER(Cursor3D, HandleUpdate));
  // e.g.  node_-&gt;CreateComponent ...
}</code></p>
<p>Currently, I create a “CursorBase” node with the Cursor3D component. It can be attached to the camera node, it has a Plane for raycasts, and a WeakPtr to a completely independent node with the actual visual cursor it positions. But you can make the hierarchy whatever seems most convenient for you, e.g. if you find the inherited transforms useful.</p>
