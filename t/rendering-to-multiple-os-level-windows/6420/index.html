<p>Does Urho3D support rendering the same scene to multiple OS-level windows via different cameras / shaders?  I have done some digging and it doesn’t look like it, but I see SDL seems to support this, so I am reasoning that it should be possible:</p>

<h3><a href="https://discourse.libsdl.org/t/does-sdl2-actually-support-multiple-windows/25933" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Does SDL2 actually support multiple windows?</a></h3>
<p>It’s possible to call SDL_CreateWindow multiple times and it indeed opens multiple windows, but what then? Specifically, how to swap buffers when multiple windows are present?  // Render window1. SDL_GL_MakeCurrent(glContext1, window1);...</p>

<p>I am extending an application which renders via multiple cameras to multiple RenderSurfaces, but all of these are displayed within the same SDL window (as textures within the scene).  I see that multi-window support is not a critical use case for Urho3D users, but in my case there is not alternative-- I have multiple output displays which need to be driven simultaneously with the same scene.</p>
<p>If it is not already supported, can somebody outline for me what I need to think through and implement to get it done?  To me it looks like the graphics class really wasn’t intended to do this, and I am hoping to do minimal damage to make it work and maybe even generate a PR to share this work.  I would also appreciate a guestimate of how hard this is likely to be.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Something like that was done for Dear ImGUI integration in the fork:<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/***/***/blob/master/Source/Urho3D/SystemUI/SystemUI.cpp" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://github.com/***/***/blob/master/Source/Urho3D/SystemUI/SystemUI.cpp</a><br/>
I don’t know all the details, but the general idea was to let ImGUI handle multiple windows and use render to texture for rendering into windows provided by ImGUI.<br/>
<code>Graphics</code> was left untouched and I don’t see any realistic way to add multi-window support there.</p>
<p>Last time I checked it worked ok-ish with rare layout bugs on ImGUI side.<br/>
So, that’s the easiest way: let ImGUI handle this stuff and glue it to <code>Graphics</code> with a couple of hacks.</p>

<p>Thank you for your guidance on this.  I am sure you are right, but I am also stubborn.  What I see is that Graphics is 1:1 with the SDL Window.  If I create a second Window by creating other Graphics object sharing the same context (setExternalContext), I get another window, with rendering to the first one still working.  What I don’t understand is how set up a second renderer and viewport so that they work with this second window.  What is driving my stubbornness is that I think I know how to make this work in OpenGL, but of course we are multi-platform and I am roughing this in on D3D9 / Win10.   Is this a totally lost cause, or is there potential feasibility to make this work through SDL?</p>

<p><code>Graphics</code> is singleton, you cannot create another instance of it.<br/>
Well, you can do that technically, but it’s not expected (and was never designed) to work in defined way. First (but not last) obstacle is abundance of mutable static variables in <code>Graphics/*</code>.</p>
<p>I predict one of the following outcomes:</p>
<ol>
<li>It will crash or assert;</li>
<li>Only first <code>Graphics</code> will work properly, others will be disabled or broken;</li>
<li>Multiple instances of <code>Graphics</code> will interfere with each other in unpredicatble ways;</li>
<li>Any combination of items 1-3.</li>
</ol>
<p>I neither know nor care enough to try estimating the scope of such task (which is equivalent to overall <code>Graphics/*</code> refactoring).</p>

<p>Wow that is super helpful, especially as I overlooked the static vars and since the constructor is public I assumed it was not a singleton.  So if I wanted to take a stab at this it would have to start with building a multi-instance/multi-window version of Graphics and then probably spiral out of control into crazyland breaking every other class in a codebase I have zero experience with.  Sounds like a party.</p>
<p>One last question while I have your ear: if I went down this rabbit hole, would <em>anyone</em> else benefit from this?  The reason I ask is that I notice that Unity3D supports this, so there must be some demand for it.</p>
<p>I guess the only sane option in Urho3D  is the first one you outlined.  Thanks for staying with me to make the case.</p>

<p>In my opinion, risks outweight the benefits.</p>
<p>You don’t exactly need multiple native windows for <em>games</em>, I don’t remember I have ever played 3D game with more than one window.</p>
<p>And if you need it for tools, then ImGUI+Render-to-texture is much simpler and less invasive solution than trying to refactor whole <code>Graphics</code> stuff.</p>
