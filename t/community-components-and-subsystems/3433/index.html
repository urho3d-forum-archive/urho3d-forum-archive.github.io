<p>I was thinking: It seems like lately people have been writing custom reusable Urho3D components or otherwise wanting Urho3D to have more useful components.</p>
<p>Would it make sense to start a separate community repository that consists of a collection of small, useful components that can easily be added to your project next to Urho?</p>

<p>My opinion is that small useful components should go to core.<br/>
Also a carefully selected set of bigger high level components<br/>
should go to core to set as basis, as these will be well tested and<br/>
work well after upgrades. The alternate repository might not work with latest versions of Urho,<br/>
which is hard problem as we can’t expect individual developers to be up to date - many<br/>
prefer not to update at all.</p>

<p>Well, for something specialized there could be something like “contrib” stuff in main repository, which is maintained like<br/>
"experimental" code.<br/>
But that doesn’t mean  Urho should avoid hight-level components in core - there is basic set which is expected to have,<br/>
like IK, Ragdolls, AI components like Behavior Tree, etc. with carefully created editors and easy to use by people.<br/>
Otherwise these will have to be constantly reinvented. There is no enough high-level components in Urho.</p>

<p>On the one hand, putting things into Urho core helps community reuse them.<br/>
On the other hand, it will bloat Urho core.</p>
<p>Urho core is simple and lightweight for now. I am not about actual code size, I am mostly about generic achitecture. It has few basic blocks that could be reused in the million of differect tasks.</p>
<p>One we start adding things to Urho code, it will lose its elegance. It will be getting bloated… E.g. I dislike <code>RibbonTrail</code>. It is nice feature, but I doubt that it is as generic and reusable as e.g. <code>StaticModel</code>. For me it’s something that should lay as 3rdparty asset like Skybox or smth else.</p>
<p>Possible soluion is to put all these things into Urho3D.lib but separate them from Urho core file and class tree.</p>

<p>As currently things are, not including stuff with core means that the stuff is basically unusable - it will not be updated,<br/>
it will not be built. Also making people start easier with their project is much more preferred than keeping things lightweight. If you don’t use things you don’t need they are not included with your software and do not consume resources.</p>

<p>I like the idea too.  To prevent the code rot, we could setup nightly CI (or something like that) on those components and subsystem against the current master branch of Urho3D repo. Granted that it will not verify the correctness nor the functionality provided by them, but at the very least we know immediately enough which one break and does not build cleanly. And in order not to burden the core developers, we could setup the CI build notification to be sent to the maintainer(s) of each component/subsystems directly. Maintainer that fails to perform the maintainer role can be replaced or in the event no one else could replace him/her then the component/subsystem itself could be ejected from the community repository (or being marked as DEPRECATED / ONLY WORK WITH specific old version of Urho3D).</p>
<p>If we really decide to do this, IMHO, the community repo should be resided in the <a href="https://github.com/urho3d">urho3d</a> org  in GitHub. It does not only have a maximum visibility there but also technically it is easier to setup all the above when they are centralised. Note that I do not mean to say you can’t have your own components/subsystems outside if/when we have this setup in place.</p>

<p>I need to stress an idea that if this repository will have any chance do doverge from main Urho or have any difficulties<br/>
building it (in relation to main tree) it is not worth it. It should not become class 2 citizen in infrastructure,<br/>
so it is “still part of Urho” and separation is “for maintenance needs”. Otherwise it will become nightmare to maintain and support so it eventually die out (probably engraving some good things). So it should not be a case for “lets remove features” direction of some community members (who apparently need some kind of OSG/Ogre3D/Irrlicht to just play their shader games and do not care for much else). So that means it is a subject to bugs in issue tracker and release management.</p>

<p>Just want to clarify. We can have many repositories in the same “urho3d” org. So the new community repo(s), should we agree to put them there, won’t bloat the existing “urho3d/Urho3D” repo.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is too early to talk about having a  convenience way/tool to auto download/configure the optional components/subsystems, but the idea is certainly intriguing. In my day work I use <a href="https://start.spring.io/">https://start.spring.io/</a> to quickly generate a new Java/Kotlin project. I agree with you that it will be cool if we are heading to that direction.</p>

About integration, I think it is sufficient to keep the same dir structure. It takes to decide how to number/name additional examples (not core components) so they don’t clash.<br/>
For core components, please head to the urho3d steering committee… <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/95940790c23d98635b2a6d3f22657158.png" title=":wink:"/><br/>

<p>Seriously I don’t have all the answers but this is how I see it. Don’t treat the community components/subsystems as a CMake target where they need to be built separately and linked against the canonical Urho3D lib. There is no canonical version anyway. Instead, treat them as optional source codes to be built into the each person customized Urho3D lib. So, we can just set aside a subdir in the Source/ and tell our build system to recurse into it to find the source codes, if any. I think that would work.</p>

<li>Repository with modules break.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think there should be CI for both repos so if change occurs in Urho3D, both should be checked, as<br/>
API consistency is on the one who changes it, not on otheres.</p>
<p>In addition - putting stuff manually in main Urho repo leads to huge can of worms and usability problems.<br/>
The repository should be created, maintained, usage should be standard, the doc should be written on how to add<br/>
own modul to the repo. Otherwise it will be huge crap pile and Urho usability and popularity will decrese below zero.</p>
<p>You know, products are used not because they are thin, they are used because they do what you want.<br/>
The ones who don’t want stuff can just remove everything they don’t need.</p>
<p>I do understand that maintaining more code is harder than maintaining less code, but I think if<br/>
the tossed code gets no attention it is the same as dead. Nobidy will happily search all Internet for modules,<br/>
then try to match versions with Urho, find which oes work, etc. There are much more established platforms<br/>
which tried this approach for ages, they at least found some solutions to this problem. I think Urho should not repeat these errors.</p>

<p>I have created a new team called “Community repository maintainers” and invited <span class="mention">@TheComet</span> to join. Once he has accepted that, I will set him as the maintainer of the new team. Anyone else that would like to help may request to join the team, subjected to team maintainers approval. Below is how I think we could set this up. Open for discussion.</p>
<p>This new team will be the parent team of all the other subteams. Each substeam is associated with one repository. The member of the subteam is the maintainer of the repository. Each repository only contains the source code for one component or subsystem. An individual can be a member of multiple subteams, of course. The repository may be originated from “urho3d” org or just a forked from external repository originated from other personal account or organization account in GitHub with compatible permissive license as Urho3D project. That is, the developer of a new component/subsystem or the would-be-maintainer (in case it is not the same person as the original developer) has to approach the “Community repository maintainers” to request for joining the community, although at the initial stage I expect we are the one that would be more proactive to invite them in (or just fork them anyway :-).</p>
<p>The CI setup will be daily cron-based. Each repo maintainer can decide what is the best time to run. I hope travis-ci and appveyor are able to sync up with the team structure setup above and allow the maintainer to configure the cron jobs independently. To be verified.</p>
<p>The build system will be revised slightly to allow library builder (or CI) to “download” additional source code from one or more community repositories before configuring/generating the initial build tree. Any one who has a better idea than this or objecting this approach, please shout now. The CI for each repo simply uses this new enhancement to test build each component/subsystem against master branch of Urho3D repo. Maintainers will be notified of any build failures as discussed before.</p>

<p>Why having hundreds of repos is a problem?

We can easily create a page to catalog all the components and subsystems with their past build history. The active repos will float to the top and the inactive ones sink to the bottom organically. The key point is, each repository is maintained by each subteam; and you and TheComet are the maintainers of the team structure only (unless of course when you guys also happen to have your own components/subystems in the community repo).</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I have considered both carefully. I believe in the long run the multiple repos approach is in fact has more benefits than drawbacks. Being able to fork or clone individually is already a big win to me. An original developer of the component who happens to be also an expert in Git/Github, may choose to host it in his/her own personal Github account and still be able to participate in the community repo via a fork (changes could be pushed/pulled in both directions). The source code is self-contained and can be self-documented with single page <code>README.md</code>. Having separate build status per repo. Selfishly, it is also easier for me when modifying the build script as it is easier to say, hey, take <em>all</em> the source codes and build scripts from the chosen community repos and not have to worry about the directory structure of each repo, which would have been the case if a single repo can contain multiple components/subsystems. I can keep going <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/7bdd5ab4d67675d002d99e4b948c8cdb.png" title=":slight_smile:"/>.</p>
<p>As for the drawbacks of “potentially” having too many of them, it can be easily mitigated as I mentioned above.</p>

<p>I think we have already answered that. The separation to put them in the community repos is really a separation of concerns. The Urho core will do its business as usual unaffected by community. The release could be automated though. As it is now our release/deploy process is already automated using a rake task triggered by CI jobs when it sees a release-tag has been made, so it is relatively easy I think to enhance that rake task to make a synchronous release-tag to all the community repos (native or fork) under our Github organization that have made it, i.e. build cleanly in the past 24 hours against the master branch (I know Travis provides an API client to query for such information, I bet Appveyor does too). If you haven’t noticed, our copyright license year is bumped up automatically and synchronously to all our repos using similar automation.</p>

<p>Not sure we have reached any consensus yet. But so far I believe it is leaning toward having multiple repos containing source code module. I have an idea build on top of that which I would like to share as soon as we have reached the agreement.</p>

<p>Ok. I will take that as though we have reached a consensus since there are no more objection for the multiple repositories approach. As promised, I would like to share more how I see it implemented before actually doing any work on it. In other words, as of this writing I don’t know whether they could be fully implemented or not.</p>
<p>Each individual repository is a “module” which contains a collection of C++ source code, CMake build scripts, and assets if any. It may just contain things for a single component but It may as well be a group of related components. It may even be a complete new subsystem containing many components working together. The “module” may use other modules as its dependencies (like Russian doll). Library user has the freedom to mix and match the modules in their own project.</p>
<p>There will be a new user defined metadata file in JSON format describing this dependencies. Similar to the <code>dependencies</code> key in <code>package.json</code> for those who familiar with node.js development. Then there will be a cross-platform CLI tool to automatically read this metadata file and do all the necessary (like git cloning the source modules recursively) to bootstrap the project. Analogy to <code>npm install</code> for node.js. One way to implement such cross-platform CLI tool is by leveraging on the <code>cmake -P</code> feature. For instance, we could use the <code>execute_process()</code> to spawn other subprocesses. We can wrap this inside a batch file/shell script called <code>csm.bat</code> or <code>csm.sh</code> or something like that. CSM stands for “CMake Source Module”. Well, unless you guys have better name for it. So, the complete command to install all the source codes will be as simple as: <code>csm install</code>.</p>

<p>I have no major objections to this approach, but will note two things.</p>
<p>Using bat/sh initially seems like a bad idea to me, because it requires you to effectively maintain two implementations of the same tool.</p>
<p>CMake has facilities to clone repositories and parse JSON (look at the ExternalProject submodule for example). Would it make more sense to write “csm” in cmake instead?</p>
<p>As to the name, I feel like “USM” might be a better name (Urho3D source module).</p>

<p>That’s exactly what I originally had in mind! Writing a cross-platform script using CMake script in itself and call the script using <code>cmake -P csm.cmake -Dinstall=1</code>, which is a mouthful however. Thus the proposed convenience batch file or shell script is just a thin wrapper for invoking the CMake script, but contains no business logic.</p>
<p>But considering this tool could support other options, the wrapper script itself may require logic to parse arguments properly, and worse, we have to do it for batch file too, I am thinking may be the tool might be developed using C++ as well. Solve the portability and other issue in one go.</p>

<p>I call it CSM because the new tool needed to be made available to the library builder before it downloaded/clone Urho3D project itself. I also want it to be more generic, i.e. It can be used for other projects as well. In other words, the “urho3d/Urho3D” is a value in one of the key in this <code>modules.json</code> file. But its value can be anything else.</p>
<p>The use case would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>library builder acquires the tool (clone and build from source)</li>
<li>library builder prepares the <code>modules.json</code> in the root of source tree by using the tool</li>
<li>library builder install the source codes from all the modules by using the tool</li>
<li>library builder uses cmake and make as of today to build the library with the optional modules built-in.</li>

<p>However, I am fine to scale it back too if you all think it is too ambitious. Regardless of the scope of this new tool, its end result will be the same. Under the original source tree of Urho3D there will be a new subdir called “Source/Modules” containing yet more subdirs from each repo. So this weekend when I have time at least I could start to work on that to modify our build system to automatically discover CMake build scripts from each module and then invoke them to give them a chance to configure what is needed for each module.</p>

<p>I like the idea as you have proposed it.</p>
<p>We can work towards it step-by-step with the goal of adding repo’s now while the automated process is being developed, eg</p>
<ul>
<li>we need a template repo/cmake script so contributions can start going in, and hopefully the changes to get them working with the automated system will be small</li>
<li>we can use basic git commandline to clone in the short term</li>

<p>Anyone can keep their own pet component in their own github account. If they decide to join and host in the community repos then they have to commit themselves to maintain the component against the Urho core, which is a moving target. As discussed, unmaintainted module will naturally break (CI notified the maintainers every day as long as it still break). Also user will not use such components and eventually I foresee we will have some kind of steering committee to decide when to prune the unmaintained modules.</p>
<p>So, do or do not, there is no try. If it is not ready and break the CI since day one then don’t bother as it will just waste our CI computing resource.</p>

<p>So I’d set the following limitations for “contrib” components:</p>
<p>i) the component file structure:</p>
<ol>
<li>2 files - Component.h and Component.cpp (replace Component with a name).</li>
<li>tests directory with unit tests which run sequentally for the component, each test should return 0<br/>
as process (and not crash). Tests run noninteractively and headless (?)/</li>
<li>examples directory with usage.</li>
<li>doc directory with component.dox file which describes component and all the documents are added to the documentation.</li>

<p>ii. Should compile,all (including examples and tests) against current Urho tree,<br/>
unit-test should succeed.</p>

<p>Nope. We already agreed that our build system doesn’t need any knowledge of the internal structure of each repo.</p>
<p>I will leave to the community repo maintainers to decide the entry criteria. I suppose the usefulness of a module is more important than whether, says, it has complete documentation or none at all; or that it has a dozens of unit tests or none at all.

<p>Guys, chill.</p>
<p>I do agree with slapin’s proposal to have at least some minimal guidelines as to how things should be structured. While you can make the build system so generic to the point where this structure can be completely user-defined, the argument is more about ensuring quality and consistency.</p>
<p>I think a reasonable enforcement is to require the directory structure to be similar to how Urho3D already structures stuff. I also believe it’s reasonable to enforce inclusion of docstrings, and obviously, the code should actually compile and run correctly (maybe not go as far as unit tests, but a sample would be nice).</p>

<p>I could be wrong but my idea of community repos is that they should have minimal guidelines as possible so that more people are encouraged to participate. I don’t need the modules to be standardized. They could be developed by each of their maintainers/developers with their own code style and coding convention. It’s just like how it is with our 3rd-party libs are and yet there is not much of a big problem to integrate them. There should be some guideline to be adhered to, that I agree.

<p>That’s about to change! I believe the decision was made for <span class="mention">@weitjong</span> to adapt Urho’s build system to facilitate the inclusion of external repositories containing components and to create a “hello world” sample repository demonstrating how the system should be used. When he has time and implements this, I have a few of my own components ready to contribute and hopefully from there we can get this project rolling.</p>

<p>This is off topic to this thread, but my thoughts on Urho3D are this: The only thing going for it is its clean design. In every other aspect it has become inferior to other engines (I’m looking at Godot). I really wish someone would implement some new rendering features, such as dynamic GI, because everyone I ever talk to about Urho3D turn it down becase its graphics look bad.</p>
<p>With that said, I will be staying with Urho3D for a while as I write my game using it, and I want to believe it can grow in the future. I happen to believe graphics not maketh the game, <strong>gameplay</strong> maketh the game.</p>
<p>Having a collection of community components will definitely help spark some interest in moving the engine forwards.</p>

<p>Yep. Light mapping, light probes, real-time GI…<br/>
PhysX with clothes and fluids.</p>
<p>I’m revisiting Urho renderer during last month. It’s not that bad, but definitely has some weak points.<br/>
GI and all these lighting things would be quite complicated from algorithmic point of view. I’m quite familiar with graphics, but still. Maybe <span class="mention">@dragonCASTjosh</span> have tried something like this?</p>

<p>When you started off this thread, I was (still am) very supportive because I like to see that happens too. However, it was before the project has lost Lasse. I too don’t want to waste my time. The Urho3D project is what its users want it to be. If you want something, make your hand dirty and if the result is good, share it by contributing it back to the project.

<p>Perhaps if we introduced some structure, management wise, the Urho3D project could be more successful. What if we had “developer meetings” every week, where we discuss what’s being worked on and had a roadmap and timeplan in place to track progress of new features? If you look at blender or Ogre3D for example, if you want to contribute a new feature or fix an existing feature in those projects, you first have to put in a well structured proposal document and get it approved by the core developer team. In this proposal you state how long it will take you, what parts of the code you’re affecting, etc. and this allows the core developer team to create a timeplan for you and track what you’re doing.</p>
<p>A system like this would also prevent what happened to <span class="mention">@Lumak</span>, where multiple people are working on conflicting ideas.</p>
<p>Just some thoughts. Maybe the Urho3D project is too inactive to warrant such a system. Over the last week I’ve only seen about 2-3 people writing code.</p>
<p>While I did like the lay back style of Lasse, I think if we are serious about advancing Urho3D we should also be more serious about managing the advancements.</p>

<p>However, I feel community components/subsystem will be a great boost to this engine, at least keep it sustained and , kind of, active for a while. It will help pool together a good number of interesting and quality component/subsystem implementations and even experiments that have been done in isolation.</p>
