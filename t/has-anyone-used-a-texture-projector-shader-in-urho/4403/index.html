<p>Hello folks,</p>
<p>I’m experimenting with shaders in Urho a bit and I’d like to create an effect similar to Unity’s Projector component, which displays a texture mapped onto the mesh it is pointed at. I found a couple resources online, including this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22732717/opengl-projective-texture-mapping-via-shaders" rel="nofollow noopener">StackOverflow link</a> that seems to have a lot of what I need. But that’s not an urho-specific answer, and I’m new enough to working with shaders that I’m having some trouble understanding it sufficiently to translate that information to use in urho. I was wondering if anyone has previously worked with a similar shader effect in Urho or could point me in the right direction for adapting the one in the link.</p>
