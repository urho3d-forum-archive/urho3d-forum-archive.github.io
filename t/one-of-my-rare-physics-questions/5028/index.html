<p>What is the best Urho3D event to “override the transform on bullet dynamic rigidbodies” in order to align them to the animated skeleton?</p>
<p>Kinematic bodies stick to my animated models like they were glued there, its really cool.<br/>
But under Bullet, kinematic objects don’t get “restitution”, or even “penetration correction” when collisions occur with anything else. Kinematic bodies are rarely useful! I need to drive dynamic bodies, with constraints would be a bonus</p>

<p>Kinematic bodies are ideal for triggers, which are not uncommon in games. And in general one should not expect behavior after explicitly disabling it. <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/58bcd684421190f24be1944e2a997a04.png" title=":wink:"/></p>
<p>Maybe you could use point constraints? Also, how far are you planning to take this physical walking? You seem to be taking it further than IK. Will your zombies need a sense of balance? Maybe the animations could provide a reference for simulated muscles that would apply forces to the limb bodies instead of them being kinematic? Will you still need pre-made animations in the end? Or are you working towards something like…</p>

I’m looking to create a hybrid controller, which has some IK, but stops short of full-body IK, and joint-motor velocity corrections… the plan is merely to provide additive blending of poses generated from partial ragdoll chains and the animated pose.</p>

<p>What makes physics so important for this purpose?</p>
<p>The IK sample uses the <code>SceneDrawableUpdateFinished</code> event to apply IK, btw.</p>

<p>Physics is important to me, I want full ragdolls (the easy part), and partial ragdolls, to inherit the momentum implied by the animated state they were in at the time they switched to ragdoll mode.<br/>
I want to be able to use a blend-solver to recover from full ragdoll mode, by determining poses for the physics objects based on the animated skeleton state and the motionstate offsets.<br/>
I want the simulator to deal with twitch animations resulting from hitting an animated ragdoll - not additive blending of canned animations.</p>
<p>Yep, that’s what I use for IK and foot-slipping - I assumed that animation would have been performed at this point, and I have a last chance to transform things, but so far, I get some strange results <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/33cb8d9bf277cdb113680cf5564b6764.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>
