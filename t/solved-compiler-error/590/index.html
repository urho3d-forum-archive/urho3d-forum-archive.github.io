<p>Hi, i have a problem, when i compile the project with codeblocks i get this error: unrecognized command line option ‘-static-libstdc++’.<br/>
Any solution?<br/>
Thanks <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/ab33f6c546ca85e7d84a4e3c32cd4034.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>

<p>Welcome to our forum.</p>
<p>Although we try to be as inclusive as possible, our build scripts may not able to support all the combinations of IDE/Compiler/Host-system out there. Code::Blocks project using UNIX Makefile with MinGW cross-compiler on Linux host system has been tested to build our project fine. So does the “standalone” MinGW compiler on Windows host system. I can only suspect that the MinGW compiler shipped by the Code::Blocks binary download is the culprit. If you quickly google the “mingw” and “static-libstdc++” as your search keyword then you will find others have encountered the same problem as you as well. One of the search result catches my attention: <a href="http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/download.php">mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/download.php</a>, then configure your Code::Blocks to use that toolchain. The TDM-GCC 4.81 may probably make the same ‘mistake’ as 4.71 in its handling of this compiler flag. So although it is more troublesome, if I were you I would go with standalone MinGW route.</p>
<p>HTH.</p>
