<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I keep discovering Urho3D (a really wonderful 3D engine) and now I try to render an object (a space ship) with some transparent parts (cockpit window pane), and I come here for an advice.<br/>
I have modelled the object in Blender made of a hull and a window pane (two different objects in Blender) which have different materials. For the window pane, I set the transparency factor to something close to 0. It renders fine within Blender.<br/>
On first approach, I exported both objects in one single “mdl” file.<br/>
Then, to render it in Urho3D, I create one single node under my main scene. To that node, I attach a static model, set the model file along with a “xml” material file. However, the material file applies to the entire object, the hull and the window pane.<br/>
The result is that the window pane is not transparent !</p>
<p>I change the way to address the problem.</p>
<p>From Blender, I exported the hull to one object, and the window pane to another one.<br/>
In Urho3D, I then create a single node under the scene. Then, under that node, I create two other nodes, first one is assigned the hull object, and the second node is assigned the window pane.<br/>
By doing that, I am able to assign different “xml” material files, and for the window pane, I use something like that:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;material&gt;
	&lt;technique name="Techniques/DiffUnlitAlpha.xml" quality="0" /&gt;
	&lt;parameter name="MatDiffColor" value="0.5 0.5 0.5 0.45" /&gt;
	&lt;parameter name="MatSpecColor" value="0.5 0.1 0.1 40" /&gt;
	&lt;parameter name="MatEmissiveColor" value="0.5 0.5 0.5 0.1" /&gt;
&lt;/material&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The material file assigned to the hull object is rendered using a simple “diff.xml” technique.</p>
<p>The result is what I expected. The hull is opaque and the window pane is transparent with an alpha value of 0.45. This works fine.</p>
<p>However, I was wondering if there is another method which could avoid splitting a complete object into several smaller “mdl” objects with different materials ? Is it possible, under Urho3D, to load one single “mdl” file, and load several material files and have some materials assigned to some sub-objects by using their names for example ?</p>
<p>I hope my request is clear enough, but if you need more information, I would be very pleased to provide you with some code if it can help.</p>
<p>All my best regards !</p>

<p>Enable “Materials text list” in blender. Will be created file Models/MODEL_NAME.txt with materials list. In game you can use <span class="bbcode-i"> object-&gt;ApplyMaterialList();</span> for use this file. In editor this file loaded automatically (as long as I remember)</p>

<p>Hello 1vank, thanks for your advice.<br/>
I followed your instructions and it works fine !<br/>
Here is what I did in details?</p>
<p>From Blender, I exported all my meshes into a single <span class="bbcode-i">model.x</span> file. It includes the hull and the window pane.</p>
<p>Using the <span class="bbcode-i">AssetImporter</span>, I convert the <span class="bbcode-i">model.x</span> file into a <span class="bbcode-i">model.mdl</span> file but I added the “-l” option.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$ AssetImporter model model.x model.mdl -l</code></pre>
<p>This also creates a <span class="bbcode-i">model.txt</span> file that looks like this :</p>
<p><code>Materials/Fuselage.xml
Materials/Nickel.xml
Materials/Vitre.xml</code></p>
<p>In the <span class="bbcode-i">bin/Data/Materials</span>, the XML files shown above have been created. Then, I can modify the file called <span class="bbcode-i">Vitre.xml</span> (sorry, file name is in french but it is the file that defines transparency for the window pane) to use the <span class="bbcode-i">DiffUnlitAlpha.xml</span> technique for rendering window pane material (transparent).</p>
<p>In my source code, I create the static model with the following lines:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">?
shipModel = shipNode-&gt;CreateComponent&lt;StaticModel&gt;();
shipModel-&gt;SetModel(cache-&gt;GetResource&lt;Model&gt;("Models/model.mdl"));
shipModel-&gt;ApplyMaterialList();
?</code></pre>
<p>The call to method <span class="bbcode-i">ApplyMaterialList()</span> without parameter tells Urho3D to read materials definition from a file called <span class="bbcode-i">model.txt</span> (it only replaces the <span class="bbcode-i">.mdl</span> extension by <span class="bbcode-i">.txt</span>), the one for which the content is displayed above.</p>
<p>And it works fine !</p>
<p>Thanks !</p>
