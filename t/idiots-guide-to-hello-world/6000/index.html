After <a href="https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_building.html">building Urho3D</a>, the section <a href="https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_using_library.html">Using Urho3D Library</a> is official reference for setting up and building a project. [Note: it is temporarily outdated in that it refers to build scripts (*.bat *.sh) once in the Urho3D root directory that were moved to Urho3D/<strong>script</strong>, so could change your command invocation slightly.]</p>
<p>Indeed, Urho3D Project Template is active and filling with useful features.</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes?</p>

<p>Thank you for your replies.</p>
<p>I looked at the GitHub thing and yes I could download the files but then I would not have a clue what to do with them and there are no instructions, this is why I am asking for an idiots guide.</p>
<p>I looked at the “docs” link and how to get started. The first line mentions Windows and visual studio with no further links. The second line mentions Linex. Then is raspberyPI and then macOS and then it just goes on and on and I was confused at the second line.</p>
<p>Just a simply idiots guide would be perfect. I see visual studio was mentioned, wheres the visual project to download that would have everything already setup within?</p>
<p>What is cmake? alright, I know, but the instructions say, use cmake, and my question is how? and there is no explaination on how to use cmake.</p>
<p>Just a simply idiots guide step by step from downloading to files from the github to executing the final result would be awesome.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of this engine is that the first step is difficult. Cmake is still unfamiliar to many Windows users. If someone write a simple fool tutorial to teach novices to compile examples, it is estimated that there will be more users. The documentation on how to build the engine library is too complicated for users unfamiliar with cmake, which will discourage a group of potential users / contributors.</p>

<p>I agree, there is definitely a steep learning curve for the engine if someone is new to C++ and/or CMake. But I don’t think that means we should not have CMake, for example - what would the alternative be? A visual studio file you must manually edit to get the proper build flags and files, which only works on Microsoft’s IDE? We certainly can’t make the case that C++ has a steep learning curve, so we should use a different language for the engine, and I think it’s similar for CMake.</p>
<p>I do agree, though, there could definitely be a better tutorial setup, if not in the Docs then in the Wiki/forum. Fortunately anyone is welcome to add to the former, and this thread provides the latter <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/7bdd5ab4d67675d002d99e4b948c8cdb.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>

<p>We don’t need to give up cmake, cmake is fine. I think we should give newbies a simple start. For example, the beginning of the document should be:<br/>
1.install visual studio and cmake,<br/>
2.enter “cmake …” command,<br/>
3. Open and compile with visual studio.<br/>
so they can build the engine and examples with simple operations. Then go into the detailed build options. They don’t even need to learn C ++ to do the above tasks. They can see the face of the engine. Like the first helloworld example in the c programming language book, this should be the best.</p>

<p>You’re missing CMake. If you did not install it do so now. If you did, ensure that the directory containing cmake is included in the PATH environment variable (some directions <a href="https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a> for adding directories to the path if you’re not familiar with it).</p>
<p>The build directory is expected to not exist - the build script creates it.</p>
<p>If you want, you can also use the cmake-gui to run CMake, though you don’t get the the scripts automatically picking the right compiler and flags for the build for you. My preference is to use the scripts to initially create the build (which sets the right stuff for web builds and such for me by picking the right script), then I modify build flags like a shared vs static build using the GUI.</p>

<p>We need to review what noob guidance <em>CMake itself</em> actually has.  “Learn how to use CMake” is a perfectly valid thing to tell people to do, same as learn C++.  Thing is, people here are giving causal advice to do command line CMake stuff, and that’s complete nonsense.  CMake has a GUI tool.  It’s pretty straightforward to use, at least as far as build systems go, if you’ve been briefed on the basic method of operation.  Which is something <a href="http://cmake.org" rel="nofollow noopener">cmake.org</a> should have as a readily available material.  I <em>hope</em> they have it, I’ll go check later.  Something that could derail that agenda, is their historical tendency to sell books on how to use CMake, to make money.</p>
<p>Ok <em>unfortunately</em> pointing a complete noob at <a href="http://cmake.org" rel="nofollow noopener">cmake.org</a> is not a kind thing to do.  Kitware is oriented towards convincing business managers to switch to a CMake build system, and earning consulting fees helping businesses make that switch.  The documentation is fine for someone who already knows what a build system is and how to swim through tech stuff in general, but it’s not geared towards a noob game developer at all.  Probably Kitware has put all the “digestible” stuff into their Mastering CMake book, which you have to pay for.</p>
<p>I don’t know if a third party “CMake noob tutorial” is available somewhere.  I had a major falling out with Kitware a long time ago.  I got kicked off their mailing list back in the day.  Yes I used to be a CMake big deal once upon a time, but not since 2008.  Pretty sure I threatened to write a “free noob book” at one point, before the end.  That’s why I can always “hum a few bars” about CMake and feel other people’s pain, but I’ve never committed to becoming someone’s CMake buildmaster again.  It was a career dead end for me.  Has tons to do with why I live out of a car and am broke now.</p>

<p>Ok, I found that web searching for “cmake tutorial” was generally <em>not</em> helpful.  It’s always stuff about how to write a build system in CMake.  Nobody wants to know about that just to build an existing project.</p>
<p>It seems that what you need to web search to get useful info, is “<strong>running CMake</strong>”.  Then for instance you might chance upon the proper section of official documentation, which looks reasonably sane.  <a href="https://cmake.org/runningcmake/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://cmake.org/runningcmake/</a></p>
<p>See if that’s enough to get you started.  If it isn’t, there are videos on YouTube that you can find, using the same search term.  I’m not going to recommend one, because I haven’t gone through them.  I don’t know which a noob would consider to be easier or harder to follow.  I just know that they are out there, and YMMV.</p>

<p>Not a comment on your answer, which seems useful, but on the cmake documentation - they seem to have completely avoided the fact that there are cmake-gui programs available on Linux, as if Windows users are the only ones who would want a GUI. Granted, they did specify the directions for Unix, not Linux, so maybe that’s why…<br/>
That was just from a quick read, so feel free to correct me if I missed something in the document.</p>

<p>ccmake is a GUI.  It’s just ugly.  I don’t think the existence of the prettier cmake-gui on Unixes bears <em>too</em> much comment, since they are trying to cover every system out there, and also want you to buy their book.  Wouldn’t shock me if that documentation hasn’t been updated in quite some time, and nobody felt like writing the cmake-gui on Unix section.</p>

CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:14 (cmake_policy):<br/>
The OLD behavior for policy CMP0026 will be removed from a future version<br/>
of CMake.</p>
<p>The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all<br/>
policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under<br/>
specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW<br/>
behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.</p>
<p>CMake Warning at CMake/Modules/CheckHost.cmake:48 (message):<br/>
Could not use MKLINK to setup symbolic links as this Windows user account<br/>
does not have the privilege to do so.  When MKLINK is not available then<br/>
the build system will fallback to use file/directory copy of the library<br/>
headers from source tree to build tree.  In order to prevent stale headers<br/>
being used in the build, this file/directory copy will be redone also as a<br/>
post-build step for each library targets.  This may slow down the build<br/>
unnecessarily or even cause other unforseen issues due to incomplete or<br/>
stale headers in the build tree.  Request your Windows Administrator to<br/>
grant your user account to have privilege to create symlink via MKLINK<br/>
command.  You are NOT advised to use the Administrator account directly to<br/>
generate build tree in all cases.<br/>

<p>I didn’t look at that project, but I don’t really get this step, ever, in any CMake build.  It’s not basically the CMake way of doing things.  The whole point is not to need system specific or compiler specific script files.  You should be running CMake on a CMakeLists.txt, that’s it, nothing else.  You don’t have to do command line anything, cmake-gui works just fine.  It will produce a .sln file.  Unless the author of the template really doesn’t get CMake and really did something odd, so that it doesn’t generate the right and expected stuff.</p>
<p>CMake is a build system <em>generator</em>.  You could generate files for Visual Studio, or for Code::Blocks, or for Makefiles, or for Eclipse, or for a number of other supported IDEs or non-IDE build tools.  Which of these you want to use for your development, is totally up to you.  But if you’re a native Windows developer, you should be using Visual Studio unless you’ve come up with a very good reason not to.  In which case, you don’t need to ask the question.</p>
<p>Been awhile since I messed with the symbolic links on Windows issue.  I believe you enable them somehow.  I probably did it a long time ago.  It’s one of those boring development issues that you will need to / should research yourself.  I remember it not being exceptionally hard to get past, someone will have written an article about it somewhere.  It’s completely boring.</p>
<p>Actually it turns out I get the same MKLINK warning.  I’ve been blowing it off / not even noticing.  Obviously doesn’t stop my build.</p>
<p>Looks like your template example code doesn’t know where to find the Urho3D you already built and put somewhere.  This is why all that .bat and command line stuff is bad advice to follow.  Ordinarily, you’d just use cmake-gui to tell stuff where everything is.  If anything is missing, you download it or install it or build it, then tell cmake-gui where it is.  You do this enough times, and all those “pink you’ve done something wrong” lines turn white.  Then you’re ready to Generate.  Then you get a .sln out of it, or whatever other IDE file if you’re not doing VS.</p>

<p>Don’t even bother.  If you’re a noob, never ever ever bother with some weird, personal, totally unfounded idea about what “should” be built or not.  First you find out if the build <em>works</em>.  Default options should work out of the box, no mucking around.  If it doesn’t work, either you did something wrong, or the person who wrote all the CMakeLists.txt did something wrong.  If you’re not doing anything weird, then it’s them.  So don’t do weird things.</p>

<p>I would suggest, to do CMake “expected hygiene” properly, do not do this.  You are polluting your source tree with new stuff.  You should keep your source tree read only.  You’re not as conscious of this because you downloaded a static .ZIP archive from GitHub.  But it would be more typical in ongoing development, to <em>git clone</em> from GitHub, and to <em>git pull</em> when you want more updates from Master.  Your local Git repository should be for the source code only and not polluted with generated build files.</p>
<p>I know that some people in the CMake universe do have a /build subdirectory personal culture.  I say they are Doing It Wrong, and don’t understand / embrace the basic distinction of source vs. build directory in CMake’s model of operation.  I don’t know what the CMake community pushes nowadays as best practices, if there’s any push at all.  Back in the day, some people wanted to do /build subdirectories and I always thought they were Doing It Wrong [TM].</p>
<p>Standard drill for when a build blows up in your face, is to completely delete the build directory and start fresh.  That’s why you don’t put it under a chunk of your filesystem that’s supposed to be read only.</p>
<p>So what I do, for instance, is have a C:\devel directory.  I git clone into that directory, resulting in C:\devel\Urho3D.  I build in C:\devel\build\Urho3D.  All of my various CMake built projects live in C:\devel\build.  I could delete my entire \build directory for every single project I ever built, if I so chose.  Such as to free up space on my crammed hard drive.</p>
<p>These distinctions about “completely separate build directory” become more important when you are <em>writing</em> CMakeLists.txt build files for other people’s consumption.  Expecting people to use a /build subdirectory in their own source tree is a bad practice, in my book pretty much unforgivable, “deserves an Issue filed” and some hounding for them to learn how to get it right.  YMMV for a small one-off project, but not acceptable for an ongoing project at the scale of something like Urho3D.</p>
<p>Not that Urho3D has / had any such problems.  Weitjong’s CMake kung fu is legion.</p>

<p>No.  That’s not the missing piece of the puzzle.  Do no such thing.</p>
<p>The missing CMake obscura, is that Penny needed to build the ALL_BUILD target.  Not just “Build the Solution” like one would expect in a sane and perfectly polished universe.  The difference is some kind of historical implementation detail, about what it took to get CMake to work in Visual Studio.  I don’t know if it’s theoretically possible for Kitware to change CMake to build things “a nicer way”, or if there are any Feature Requests for that.  But selecting ALL_BUILD and building that, is the standard operating procedure for how you do CMake in Visual Studio.</p>
<p>Once you’ve done that, everything is built and it works.  You don’t need to change launch projects.  When you want to run a target project, you click on the menu for that project specifically, and “Start Debugging”.  It’ll run.  Doesn’t matter if it’s a Release build, you still click on “Start Debugging”.  I’ve seen a “Start Without Debugging” option floating around in VS 2019, you can do that too.  But historically it’s just “Start Debugging”.  It runs.</p>

<p>Agreed. Though I’d say that it makes the rest of your post basically giving you’re opinion about (sort of) in source vs out of source build trees. Either work with Urho, and in my opinion either should work with all projects (unfortunately this is not the case, but for Urho at least it is).</p>
<p>And while I probably have less experience on the matter than you, I take the opposite approach. All projects should have a Build (or build, if you prefer) subdirectory, not a second folder elsewhere. Then when I’m done with a project being on the drive (after it’s backed up elsewhere) I just delete the whole directory for the project, rather than the separate source and build directories. Perhaps this just reflects how I prefer grouping files, though. For the files for my games I prefer grouping by, for example Maps, Characters, etc, rather than Models, Textures, Materials, etc.</p>
<p>That said, I agree that using . as the source and build directories is a bad idea (an actual in source build)</p>

<p>I’ve done CMake for money, for Mozilla, trying to convert their Firefox build to CMake back in the day.  I think that makes my opinion on out of source builds worth more.  On the other hand, I blew the gig and they didn’t make that transition back then.  So one could argue that my opinion is worth less.  <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/7bdd5ab4d67675d002d99e4b948c8cdb.png" title=":slight_smile:"/>  No seriously, I’ve had CMake kung fu in my time.

<p>No, it is in Visual Studio.  Look at all the Projects in your Solution.  One of them is called ALL_BUILD.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that your error message in your screenshot talks about ALL_BUILD.  I suspect it’s <em>part of</em> your problem.</p>
<p>I also think you’re probably doing something without Admin permissions.  Are you Admin equivalent?  Probably has to do with the MKLINK / symbolic links obscura.</p>
<p>Hmm, now that I <em>really stare</em> at your screenshot, it says that all your builds succeeded.  Perhaps you just didn’t right-click on the Sample you were interested in to “Start Debugging” it.</p>

<p>CMake does work well for what it does accomplish, which is providing a single cross-platform build for a lot of different development IDEs and toolchains.  But it’s not exactly super easy plug and play in that regard.  The learning curve for merely building with it isn’t that steep though.</p>
<p>Ok, you’ve got all these .pdb out of date errors.  Those are Program Databases, Visual Studio’s version of a debugging file.  They keep saying delete it and recompile.  I’m not sure why, but your build tree is trashed.  You need to delete it all and start over from scratch.  Totally clean.</p>

<p>I’d say there is no “best way”. There <em>is</em> several options to pick from, which are mentioned in the <a >Getting started</a> section of the wiki, but which would be considered <em>best</em> really depends on your personal preference. Reworking a sample is a good first step, as - I think - it helps to understand the structure of a basic Urho3D program more than whipping out a template right away. The <a href="https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_structure.html">Overall structure</a> section of the documentation also helps with that.</p>

<p>Thank you. I am not unfamiliar with 3D engines. All of the libraries appear to be pretty much standard expectation.</p>
<p>I am giving Urho3D a go, migrating so to say.</p>
<p>My unfamiliarity lies with cmake, Visual Studio, and of course how to create a Urho3D base project with a running null main loop.</p>
<p>Creating an empty project and linking in the includes didn’t work in this case.</p>
<p>The Empty Project Template has instructions for Ubunto but not Windows &amp; Visual Studio.</p>
<p>Not terribly familiar with C++ either so theres a learning curve with that. Spent a life time with MASM, cobol, pascal and a whole bunch of modern languages that have been around in the last 20 years.</p>
<p>So heres to my learning curve <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/7bdd5ab4d67675d002d99e4b948c8cdb.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>

<p>I have followed the guide on “Setting-up-a-Project-(CMake)”<br/>
to make my first project.<br/>
CMake seems to create the sln ok however when VS is opened there are 4 projects listed, ALL_BUILD, INSTALL, TestProject2, ZERO_CHECK</p>
<p>There is nothing inside any of these.<br/>
Is this right? The project builds but doesnt display anything in the window. What do I need to do to fix this? Thanks</p>

<p><a  rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/wiki/Setting-up-a-Project-(CMake)</a> for anyone wiki challenged.</p>
<p>ALL_BUILD should contain an expandable list of References.  For instance, Urho3D itself has a pile of these things, basically all the libraries and Samples as targets.</p>
<p>Urho3D has a folder for External Dependencies, but it doesn’t have anything in it.</p>
<p>There should be a CMakeLists.txt.</p>
<p>If you have nothing whatsoever inside of ALL_BUILD, then something is definitely wrong.</p>
<p>It’s been quite some time since I’ve written a CMakeLists.txt for brand new code, as opposed to debugging an open source project that already had one.  In short, I haven’t made a production commitment to Urho3D, becuase I’m still trying to figure out what language I want to hand write 3D art assets in.  Such as inventing my own.  So I’m not much help about <em>how</em> your CMakeLists.txt is wrong.  Just that it has to be wrong.</p>
<p>Posting it, would certainly help.</p>
<p>Back in the day, I remember GLOB being a problematic construct that could get one into trouble, due to an unexpected delay as to when it would actually evaluate in the build generation process.  I doubt it belongs as part of noob advice.</p>
<p>I also don’t approve of dorking with cmake_policy as noob guidance.  However, I’m also not motivated enough to figure out what The Right Thing To Do [TM] is.  I just want to say, for the record, that including such is absolutely terrible and completely tone deaf as far as writing noob guidance for anything.  I suspect that TRTTD is to move that machinery into the Urho3D-CMake-common module, so that nobody has to think about such an implementation detail.  And/or make any Policy go away in Urho3D, because I do see dire warnings during builds, that CMake is someday just gonna cut all that stuff off.</p>
<p>So it is possible, that the wiki page you are reading is wrong, bugged, and unhelpful.  But I don’t actually know.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Right.  Unfortunately as I alluded, in Open Source the instructions can be 1) wrong or 2) woefully out of date.  One makes up the shortfall by finding “understanding” from somewhere.  If nobody who “actually knows better” shows up, unfortunately the only thing left to do is, solve it oneself.  And then the great contribution of Open Source, is to share that pain and those fixes, so that the <em>next</em> person doesn’t suffer as much as you did.</p>
<p>Maybe nobody here can help you.  <em>But</em>, at a minimum you need to post your CMakeLists.txt.</p>

<p>Let me add my 2cents. How I go about creating my projects is to use one of the samples that come with Urho3D as the starting point – all my github examples were created following this method because it does not get any simpler than this.</p>
<p>1 - Choose a sample which closely resembles what you’re trying to accomplish<br/>
For this example, I’ll use 18_CharacterDemo as the base:<br/>
2 - copy, paste, and rename the folder --&gt; 80_MySample<br/>
3 - go into the 80_MySample folder and open CMakeLists.txt<br/>
4 - rename</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">set (TARGET_NAME 18_CharacterDemo)
 to
set (TARGET_NAME 80_MySample)
</code></pre>
<p>4 - extend that sample and add your source/header files or simply modify what’s already there<br/>
5 - open cmake_gui or use one of the cmakexx.bat files and make your project files – DONE!</p>

<p>I have modified the wiki page <a  rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/wiki/Setting-up-a-Project-(CMake)</a> to be less stupid about cmake_policy decisions.  It’s still stupid, but at least there are far fewer commands to express it.  I will look into what it would take to eliminate the remaining policies from Urho3D.  This kind of machinery should either go away completely, for the sake of any noob’s sanity, or else the machinery should be buried in an appropriate Urho3D specific CMake module.  It should not be user visible, as how the build works is Urho3D’s problem, not the user’s.</p>

<p>Where do your own source files exist?  Are they in a subdirectory called /src ?  That advice was written with that assumption in mind.  The wiki page said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You might want to put your source code in a dedicated folder like <code>src</code> for example. In such a case, then you need to tell cmake to look at this folder to find your source files by completing the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file like this:</p>
<p><em>blah blah blah</em><br/>
<em>blah blah</em><br/>
<em>blah blah blah blah</em><br/>
<em>I am the count!</em><br/>

<p>It is probably once again extremely bad noob advice, at least from the standpoint of drop-kickability.  It assumes the noob is going to absorb the meaning and importance of a CMake GLOB command, and that for some reason, this is to be preferred over explicitly naming all of one’s .cpp and .h files.  It’s not going to shock me if this is the cognitive link in the chain that went totally wrong, resulting in no targets whatsoever in your project.</p>

<p>As a newcomer, I would also like to bring my thoughts to this thread. When I first started using Urho3D I also was new to c++, CMake and how to link libraries, etc, this made reading and understanding documentation hard, not because documentation was bad.</p>
<p>It has way more to do with the fact as a beginner you don’t know all those little things that you have to know to follow that documentation, like for example setting up environment variables and how to set start-up solution, should Urho3D documentation cover all this? Probably not. <img alt=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/35a2d1f1c9f37709afb592048d58e96b.png" title=":sweat_smile:"/><br/>
Beter way to show all these things would be a video that assumes that the user knows very little about programming.</p>
<p>I could contribute and produce this video. <img alt=":blush:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/4aa2fc1b9179a94cbcf3e2e00e0d95ba.png" title=":blush:"/> <img alt=":blush:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/4aa2fc1b9179a94cbcf3e2e00e0d95ba.png" title=":blush:"/><br/>
This video should probably assume the user is a newcomer on the windows platform and has access to visual studio. Even show how to clone source using git bash and how to run CMake GUI. How to tinker with sample projects and how to set up an external project. Separate video could show how to download Android SDK, NDK, etc and how to run Gradle. Sure users still can run into problems since many of these things are machine specific and can conflict with other programs etc, but at least it would give visually a hint on how to do those things and witch button to press in a given program.</p>

<p>I personally can’t stand long videos, they put me completely to sleep!  But that’s me and not you.  If you like videos, and think there’s anyone else out there who wants to absorb programming information that way, by all means make what you want to make.  That’s how Open Source works, people work on what they can personally be interested in doing.  Not what someone would like to assign them as a labor project.  <em>That</em> costs money.  <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/537e3e653d641df5b9858e75faf3862a.png" title=":wink:"/></p>
<p>The advice on that wiki page is still <em>bad</em>.  I can’t stand that kind of bad, and that’s why I’m chipping away at its badness.  It’s not a matter of whether one only has noob coding skills.  I have plenty of skills and when coming to a new codebase, there’s <em>still</em> such a thing as bad.  Stuff needs to be dog fed.  People need to visualize how a beginner would use something, not an expert who knows 100 gory implementation details already.</p>
<p>Now granted, true noob needs are subject to noobs coming along, trying things out, and actually reporting how it went for them.  Such as has happened in this thread.  But it has bothered me, for a long time, the lack of “fit and finish” in Open Source.  That’s how I became a CMake expert back in the day, doing my best to fix other people’s <em>broken</em> builds and make the pain go away.  Got a little too good at it, learned some hard lessons that way.  Well, it’s not like you can have Open Source be perfectly smooth, that’s not how it works.  But the most obvious rough edges, they gotta get sanded down, or it’s <em>not worth anything</em>.</p>
<p>Everyone just works on what they want to be better.</p>

<p>You make some interesting points. I have to agree that a video is a great idea but also labour intensive so, if you have the time then sure go for it.</p>
<p>You ask the question, “should Urho3D documentation cover all this?”, the answer is definitely a big resounding yes. My response should be considered as from someone with the experience of writing idiots guides for some of the best minds in the world. Documentation and guides should always be written in the same way that you would write a guide that helps Albert Einstein learn how to tie his shoe laces. Saying, he should already know how to do that, well, im sorry, it shows a lack of understanding and perspective.</p>
<p>I hope you find my comments helpful.</p>
<p>bvanevery, I did create the src folder in the master as the instructions suggested but it remains empty and was not created in the build.</p>
<p>I am attempting what Lumak suggested but CMake only errors.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your suggestions. I will persists. For now.<br/>

<p>I suspect this is the root of your problem. Assuming I am reading this correctly, you didn’t actually put any source files in it, you just have the folder. With no source files, it wouldn’t surprise me that the projects are all empty. Try adding a main.cpp file to source, and maybe add a simple main function, such as this (from <a href="http://cpp.sh/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://cpp.sh/</a>)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">// Example program
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

int main()
{
  std::string name;
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "What is your name? ";
  getline (std::cin, name);
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, " &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; "!\n";
}
</code></pre>
<p>Or, for a more Urho specific example, the code at <a class="inline-onebox"  rel="noopener nofollow ugc">First Project · urho3d/Urho3D Wiki · GitHub</a> is probably a better choice.</p>
<p>In regards to Lumak’s suggestion and your results, it’s typically very hard for anyone to help if you just say there were errors without specifying what they were (typically copying and pasting the error message is the best approach to sharing it, as that avoids any missing details from summarizing/paraphrasing the message).</p>
<p>Good luck with getting it to work!</p>

I created a main.cpp within src folder and copied the code block from the “First-Project” link that you provided. I presume this is what you intended as your instructions were vague. I apologise. I created this thread asking for an “idiots guide” because the instructions provided from the start to start my first project have been completely vague. I am getting information in dips and when I follow them to the letter, as you would expect from a computer, always result in errors. I do find it odd that programmers who understand how specific you have to be to programme a computer fail to write a guide to the same standard.</p>

<p>Hey, Penny, I recorded a video yesterday to test out if it is possible to make an informative video that is a reasonable length. The test was somewhat successful without a manuscript and not much planning.<br/>
I tried to use VirtualBox to run Windows 10 VM which caused some rendering issues because of the software GPU. I am going to do a more planned version on physical hardware which I believe can be easily compressed in 10mins. <img alt=":blush:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/4aa2fc1b9179a94cbcf3e2e00e0d95ba.png" title=":blush:"/></p>

<p>When I stared at your long logfile, nothing obvious lept out at me as being wrong.  But then, I haven’t stared at that kind of logfile in awhile either.</p>
<p>I keep coming back to “the GLOB statement is written incorrectly” as the answer for why you don’t have targets.  The original wiki advice could be plain outright wrong, or insufficient in the case of an out-of-source build, or out of date due to subsequent versions of CMake, or who knows.  My CMake kung fu is not quite what it used to be, and I never used GLOB statements at all back in the day.  I remember they were trouble.</p>
<p>You could try adding a directory macro to the GLOB, per some advice I found on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34863374/how-to-use-cmake-file-glob-srcs-with-a-build-directory" rel="nofollow noopener">Stack Overflow</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">file (GLOB SRC_CPP_FILES ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/*.cpp)
file (GLOB SRC_H_FILES ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/*.h)
</code></pre>
<p>You could try explicitly listing every file, and not relying on a GLOB.  That Stack Overflow advice said, <strong>“As Phil reminds, CMake documentation doesn’t recommend this use of GLOB.”</strong>  Which is how I remember it from back in the day.  To be explicit, you’d do stuff like:</p>

<p>Switching to <code>file (GLOB_RECURSE SRC_CPP_FILES *.cpp)</code> or better <code>file (GLOB_RECURSE SRC_CPP_FILES ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/*.cpp)</code> would likely also work. (I’m not sure if the <code>${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}</code> would need to be added to the first or not). Either way, probably the easiest check is to list the files explicitly as suggested at the end of bvanevery’s post and see what happens - I assume that would result in an actual error if the file wasn’t found.</p>

<p>Confusion is understandable, but you actually have to solider through the confusion and follow at least <em>someone’s</em> advice that someone’s giving you.  Only way to move the ball forwards.</p>
<p>When you don’t know what’s going on, the basic skill is <em>hacking</em>.  Not waiting to follow directions, or even requiring an understanding of directions, to try out different stuff.  My advice is and has been, you need to hack the list of files differently.  I think GLOB is a bad idea.  I’ve given you 2 different ways to do it differently.  YMMV.</p>
<p>I don’t understand how your CMakeLists.txt can be “vastly” different from what I recently talked about, because you <em>posted</em> your own CMakeLists.txt, <em>I thought</em>, albeit with really bad forum formatting that’s hard to read.  Please use those &lt;/&gt; or ``` tricks.  You can edit old posts too.</p>
<p>It may be appropriate for you to .zip up all your project source files and directory structure, and post them as an attachment.  Then someone could try it out on their machine and see how it fails or succeeds for them.  Way easier to look at the log results too.</p>

<p>More than I bargained for, but at least it makes CMake forensics easier.  I’m poking through stuff.  Not much to say yet.</p>
<p>Based on the existence of a subdirectory called \NextBigMMO\CMakeFiles\3.17.0-rc3 I believe you are using CMake version 3.17.0-rc3.  Please install version 3.17.0 which has now been released.  In general in the future, <em>do not</em> use Release Candidates for your work.  They could be buggy, that’s why they’re Release Candidates and not official releases.  Please rebuild your project cleanly, getting rid of all the previous built and generated stuff.  This BTW is why you do out-of-source builds, to make that easy to do.  This exercise will probably not fix your problem, but who knows, just in case.  And you should not be using a RC for your work anyways, so nothing lost by doing this.</p>

<p>Hiya,<br/>
I reinstalled CMake as you suggested.<br/>
I downloaded a fresh version of Urho3D-master.</p>
<p>I generated using CMake.<br/>
Now when I go into VS to look at the samples, none of those projects have anything listed.<br/>
I did before. The samples compiled ok and will run. I simply do not understand why the files aren’t listed in the resource view.<br/>
I did update VS though, has a setting in VS been changed?<br/>
Figured it out. It was the resource view not the solution view.</p>
<p>Right! Awesome! I have compiled and run the null main loop.<br/>
I have even downloaded the template project and run that.<br/>
I feel I am now good to go.<br/>
Thank you very much for your support.<br/>
Is there anything I can provide to give back to the community?<br/>
Thank you.</p>

<p>Wow, so the problem was ultimately which tabbed window in Visual Studio you were looking at?  I would never have guessed.  Good to know.</p>
<p>The moral of the story would be to start with a “known good” CMake build of some kind, to eliminate doubt about CMake itself being bugged, your development libraries being incorrectly installed, Visual Studio not working, etc.  At least I did notice you using a CMake Release Candidate instead of a full release.</p>
<p>I will continue to look into the issues raised by this “dog feeding” exercise.  Some things could definitely be simpler.</p>
<p>The utility function define_source_files() did seem to work, as your main.cpp did exist in the Visual Studio project file.  That had me really scratching my head.</p>

<p>Yeah, as I am not that familiar with VS was unaware of the difference between the Solution view and the Resource View, not sure how or why it changed.<br/>
Another big and fantastic lesson for me <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/7bdd5ab4d67675d002d99e4b948c8cdb.png" title=":slight_smile:"/><br/>
