<p>It seems that currently once an UIElement has its Event triggered the other Buttons’ Events get silenced.<br/>
For example,when pressing in a row 2 buttons subscribed to “Pressed” or “Released” event, only the first one is triggered.<br/>
On mobiles it’s good to be able to press multiple buttons to achieve combined effects or do multi-selection…, like move + jump when move button and jump button are both pressed.<br/>
So I’d like to know how to override the default behavior of UIElement events.</p>

<p>The pressed event tracks the last element that was moused down/touched down on.  There is only 1 variable that tracks the element click.  If the element is the same for the down and up events then a ‘pressed’ event is emitted.  If that variable was refactored to be a vector it might work.  It might not be that easy as the drag code my be lumped in there as well as double click.</p>

<p>The code is basically written for mouse (one pressed element at a time), and touch is an afterthought, so yes, it would need modifications to work.</p>
