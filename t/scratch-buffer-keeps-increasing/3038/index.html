<p>I’m a little bit concerned. Whenever I select the algorithm from the dropdown in the UI, the scratch buffer increases by a bit.</p>

<p>All I’m doing is clicking on this dropdown over and over, and this is what I see in the log. Is this a problem?</p>

<p>Is scratch buffer used for drawing debug stuff and/or UI?<br/>
If I were you, I’d re-check debug drawing ops.</p>

<p>Thanks for the hint about debug drawing, that was all I needed to know to fix it. It turns out I wasn’t clearing a list of effector components when the solver gets destroyed, so every time I changed the solver I was debug drawing the same effectors more and more.</p>
