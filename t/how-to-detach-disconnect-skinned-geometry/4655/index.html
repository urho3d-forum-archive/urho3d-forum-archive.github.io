<p>Hello there,<br/>
I am trying to create a dismemberment effect for a zombie game. Let’s use the ragdoll sample for reference. I have successfully detached 2 bones (simply used ‘Enabled = false’ on a constraint). Problem: the mesh follows the bones around, stretching itself to them. This is obviously expected to happen. So, how could I prevent this ?</p>
<p>Well, I think the solution lies in modifying a bone’s influence on the vertices and then detaching some vertices, but…<br/>
1- Is it even possible to edit a model’s mesh at runtime ?<br/>
2- Is it possible to access the vertices a bone has influence to and modify them, specifically bone weights ?</p>

Although, of course, nothing prevents you from creating a copy of the vertex buffer at run time, changing the weights during copying, and then assigning a new vertex buffer to the geometry.</p>

<p>You can realistically (in Urho3D) only do this if you’re separating distinct geometries from an aggregate model, such as multiple AnimatedModel’s attached to a master.</p>
<hr/>
<p>You cannot trivially piece-meal an arbitrary mesh.</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>
<p>Make a whole ton of models and swap them</p>
<ul>
<li>Only even remotely viable if you use 3dsMax, the modifier stack can actually cope with some crazy trees of edits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>CSG is tempting, don’t waste your time</p>
<ul>
<li>you have to deal with vertex-attributes, which are non-trivial and most changes you’ll want to do will involve such</li>
<li>fake CSG can work (discard triangles and close the open-loop)
<ul>
<li>stupid when the options below exist (open-loop finding is hard)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>have to isolate <em>floating</em> geometries (from severing) into discrete meshes and then fit a physics collider to them in a tight time-span
<ul>
<li>CSG on organics is stupid slow, it’s much faster on inorganics which are less tri-soupy</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The easiest approach will be to scale the the joint at the severing point to 0 (which will collapse all geometry weighted to it or downstream to nothing) then spawning a <em>severed-limb</em> with the orientation of the severed joint had and then adding a <em>gore-flower</em> at the point the joint collapsed down to.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not very granular though</li>
<li>Not sure if it ended up there in the end but that approach was used early on in the new Doom, there’s 3 variations of a paper on that - all behind pay-walls though (1 book, 2 acad).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roll a custom exporter and write out a crap-load of different combinations of index-buffers. The old Ghoul2 system worked this way by changing the indices drawn, all vertex data was always present and gore just changed what the triangle layout was.</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, you have to spawn stuff (limb parts, gore-flowers, etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Valve’s Left4Dead2 slides are easy to find, they’re shader based though and they’ll make a mess of batching (though animated models already do that … so not a ton of loss).</p>
<ul>
<li>You still have to spawn stuff (limb parts, gore-flowers, etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, you can’t really use bullet softbodies for this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Morph targets and texture swaps are plenty for superficial gore, and complementary to anything else</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p>Realistically you’re going to have to make use of a whole bunch of different things.</p>
<p>I’m trying out a combination of Ghoul2-esque index swapping, morph-targets, Left4Dead2’s ellipsoid method, and prefab scenes for spawn-lists. I was previously using too much CSG and that was a waste of time, now I’ve moved to just using volume selections to filter triangles and then fill the open-loops for a base geo. Though my gore requirements are closer to MK than a zombie game.</p>

<p>I have thought of that method too, but it is really inefficient in my opinion. Imagine having to create all sorts of variations for every zombie model in the game. I think Chivalry Medieval Warfare used this approach, but in their case, it is rather ok due to low amount of models in the game.</p>

<p>Similiar to orefkov ideal I think, but yeah, I thought of this approach too but meh, really bad in opinion, I cant imagine myself creating every variation by hand. If I am not mistaken, Chivalry Medieval Warfare used something similar to this.</p>

<p>You mean performing boolean operations and all that ? Not gonna lie, such system would be perfect for gore games, but if I am not mistaken, the mesh has to be water-tight and non-self-intersecting, and that is a nono already. Can’t even imagine how complicated must to even implement it.<br/>
I actually have this pending idea/project in my mind of implementing an object slicer (which I believe would be easier than CSG), inspired on the one in Shadow Warrior 2. Slicing the object itself is probably easy, the biggest problem is doing that to an actual skinned and ragdolled object.</p>

<p>I also thought of that, but I see this approach as a hack more than anything else. I have seen this technique being used in some games, cant remember which though. Actually, one day I almost made a Skyrim mod that would utilize this idea of shrinking to 0, I’ve never finished the mod though.</p>

<p>I think I don’t fully understand the idea. You mean I could have multiple geometries in one place, but choose which one to render ? Is it similiar to Fallout 3’s approach ? Where artist had to define the vertices that could get removed, and also manually place the <em>gore-caps</em> ?.</p>

<p>This is the best gore method I know of, it is really modular, and if done right it works with every model in the game. I have seen this approach being used in MK9 and X, Dying Light and Shadow Warrior too. I noted it has a small disadvantage though, since pixels get ‘dicarded’, no actual geometry gets disconnect from the mesh, meaning you probably will have to spawn a generic limb.</p>

<p>Ok help me understand your idea. Correct me if I am wrong, you are saying to:<br/>
1- At design time, create a second model that has only 1 bone weight per vertex OR at runtime copy vertex-buffer and modify its vertices-weight to only 1 bone.<br/>
2- Loop cut vertex groups &lt;-- this I dont quite understand. Do you mean I should separate/cut/slice the vertices per bone ? So I could have, like, one vertex-buffer/geometry per character limb ?</p>

<p>I record small video how I make it in Blender on the example of the left hand.<br/>
</p><div class="lazyYT" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque" data-width="480" data-youtube-id="UmaSabmIHls" data-youtube-title="Make dismemberment body for Urho3D"></div>
<p>First I make copy of mesh.<br/>
Then select left arm part of mesh and separate it to different mesh.<br/>
In new mesh all vertexes add to group “lowerarm_l” and remove from others groups.<br/>
In old mesh (without left arm) - select vertices from lowerarm_l group and remove it from that group.<br/>
After I join two meshes back to one and export old mesh and new copy.<br/>
In editor create two AnimatedModel componen on one node.<br/>
For first component set usual model, for second - new model.<br/>
And then move the lowerarm_l node, alternately setting models enabled.</p>
<p>In principle, this process can be automated, and you can write a script for the Blender or right in Urho3D. However, you need to know for which vertices and by how mach you need to change weights.</p>
<p>Although now I thought - in the detachable hand it was possible not to change all the weights, it was enough to exclude the vertices from the group of the upperarm_l, and in the remaining body to exclude the vertices from the group of lowerarm_l.</p>
<p>The main problem is that the vertices in the place where the lowarm and the upperarm are connected must be doubled, as they initially belong to both groups, but in order for the model to break when the dismemberment occurs, there must be two vertices - one remains in one part , the other - in the other. That’s what I meant by the “loop cut”</p>
<p>Thus, it is possible to prepare a single model, divided into several parts, and use this model to implement the dismemberment effect.<br/>
You can also add several different morph animations to this new model.</p>
<p>Imho - best way create script for Blender, where you just select loop edge, where you need divide model, and script will do the rest.</p>

<p>Also I record process of adding shape keys in Blender for that model.<br/>
Then, in the game, in each specific case of separating a part of the body, you can set a random set of values for these keys in order to give individuality to each case and avoid sameness.<br/>

<p>Well, for all that beauty, you need to create polygons at the point of separation in this model to close the hole. Well, apply on them a blood-meat texture, well, or whatever happens in a zombie. And add the particle effect of course.</p>

<p>This is not a little for that. In Urho3D, you can also manage several models tied to individual bones of a skeleton with a single master skeleton.<br/>
If you use this mechanism, you still need to prepare several models in advance, each separately for the part of the body to be separated.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@orefkov</span>, you do know that Blender has arbitrary vertex-groups right? You can setup vertex groups and write a script to go through all of them based on naming convention, fill holes, chart the hole-fill faces, and dump the fill info like the edges and centroid (for flowers/caps/particle emitters) to read.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Blender’s shoddy FBX export doesn’t write groups into FBX selection-sets like it should.</p>

<p>Nice video, I understand you now. I still think it is is similar to Chivalry, when a model gets dismembered devs replace it with a 2nd model that have disconnected limbs. It is a rather good approach, but I really wanted to do that at runtime instead of setting everything up in blender like that.</p>
<p>I am gonna study Urho capabilities deeper and initially try 2 approaches:</p>
<p>1- At model creation, separate mesh into geometries for each dismember-able limb. Similar to Fallout 3 engine, where artists had to highlight/select which vertices could get dismembered. And then, with code, try some tricks to get the geometry to detach from the model.</p>
<p>2- Instead of dealing with geometries, I could also just use a bone-weight information of vertex and do what you did in Blender with code instead. I think this approach would be better, but I haven’t wrapped my head around it yet.</p>

Then I can offer another such idea.<br/>
You can create own version of the shader for drawing, in which the parameter will be worked out - which part of the model to draw and which not.<br/>
similar like this</p><div class="onebox lazyYT lazyYT-container" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque" data-youtube-id="SmR_Xa-_Cgs" data-youtube-title="Urho3D Models Dissolving Like Doom 3">

<p>
There is topic about it - <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/models-dissolving-like-doom-3/1625">Models dissolving like Doom 3</a></p>
<p>At the moment of dismemberment, add the second model - a duplicate of the first. Both assign this shader, for one model we ask to draw one part, for another - another.<br/>
Bonus - you will be able to portray the tearing of a zombie anywhere, not only along the joints <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/480f97b912eb537e18032299081e582a.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>

<p>Just to show off what I came up with.  See it as a poor proof of concept:</p>
<p>Things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a hack, it has bugs, it is slow and therefore should not be used in production, at least not the way I implemented it.</li>
<li>The good thing about it is that it is pretty scalable technique and doesn’t need any mesh setup, and it can probably work with any skeleton you throw at it.</li>
<li>It will kill draw calls because each detached limb is a separate AnimatedModel.</li>
<li>The code is a mess, sorry, so don’t try to understand it just run it.</li>
<li>Decals disabled.</li>
<li>Left mouse throws ball, Right mouse dismembers.</li>
<li>Dismember only occurs when ragdoll is on.</li>

<p>How it works, let’s say I shot an Arm:<br/>
PS: you will see me using the word bone and node interchangeably, because they kinda are.<br/>
1- Get the node that was hit, an arm for example.<br/>
2- Clone the node. This will also clone children, great.<br/>
3- Remove unnecessary components from original node (rigid bodies, contraints, etc.)<br/>
4- Scale original node to 0, now there is no arm.<br/>
5- Reparent cloned node for a cleaner hierarchy.<br/>
What we have so far is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original AnimatedModel without the arm, because it got scaled to 0 and has no components.</li>
<li>A cloned node that has no other component but the rigidbodies and constraints, therefore, no way to render it.</li>
</ul>
<p>And this is where the dirty hack begins. The most correct way to attach geometry to the arm would be something like this:<br/>
6- Create a new AnimatedModel, obvious step.<br/>
Now we need the arm of this AnimatedModel to follow our cloned arm right ? in other words, we need to bind our cloned arm node to the AnimatedModel. So we would do something like<br/>
7- Use a function like “ReplaceBone(originalBoneNode, newBoneNode)” that could recursively replace each original bone node of the AnimatedModel with our cloned arm bone nodes.</p>
<p>But the above 2 steps did not happen exactly like that, because there is no such function that replaces a bone with another (at least not in LUA). When you create an AnimatedModel, it automatically creates the bone nodes for you, and there is no way to replace them with custom ones. So there is no way to ‘bind’ our cloned arm node to the AnimatedModel we just created…<br/>
So I had to hack this out, and the way I did it was by, pay attention: Reparenting each new bone to their respective cloned arm bone. So each new bone gets to be a child of their respective cloned arm bone.</p>
<p>8- Scale the rest of the body in relation to the cloned arm (the inverse of step 4), so that there is no body, but jut the arm.</p>
