<p>You can submit as many games as you like as long as they haven’t been released before 2016. Winners are rewarded with a visit to Swedish and Finnish <span class="bbcode-i">top game companies</span>.<br/>
Anyone else joining the competition? I think it would be great to see more submission using Urho3D.</p>
