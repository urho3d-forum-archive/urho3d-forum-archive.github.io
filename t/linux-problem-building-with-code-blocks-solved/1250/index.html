<p>Hi, I had no problems building Urho on Windows with MSVC. But I am now trying to build it on Linux Mint.</p>
<p>I installed Code:Block and it used CGC (GNU compiler) 4.8. I also installed CMAKE with a graphical front end.</p>
<p>When I’m trying to do the configuration, I got this message coming from CMAKE:</p>

<p>No, unless you intend to target Windows platform. You should use plain vanilla GCC when you intend to target native Linux platform. Last time I tried C::B on my Linux host system (Fedora 64bit), I have not encountered any problem. I was using GCC 4.9.x then but my GCC has been upgraded to 5.1 since. I have also changed my IDE from Eclipse to Clion but they all use the GCC native toolchain with ccache support enabled. No issue so far. So, I reckon if I change the frontend IDE to C::B now with the same GCC backend, it should just work.</p>
<p>I suspect your problem has something to do with the version of GCC and somehow it has tripped over due to the way we setup PCH (precompiled header). Try to upgrade your GCC compiler toolchain to 4.9 or later. This is always the problem when using Debian-based distros where stability is more important over having the latest and greatest version available. Alternatively, instead of using 1.4, try to download the latest Urho3D from master and then passing this build option when generating the Urho3D project file: -DURHO3D_PCH=0. This new build option will instruct the build system not to use PCH at all. Thus, if indeed your GCC version tripped over due to PCH then this build option should side step the problem. Good luck.</p>

<p>I will see if I can replace this with the lastest and see… Fail at PCH again.</p>
<p>I will have to put it asside. The last version I have access is this 4.9.2 version and there are newer version but from what I’ve read, I need to recompile all the libs including the OS kernel to make it work. Won’t do that for sure. In the next attempt. I’ll check to download the last version from GITHUB and try your flag.</p>

<p>I have time to test running a build on one of my old Ubuntu VM image. It is Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS with GCC version 4.8.4, i.e. same as yours. I got no problem there with PCH enabled. I generated the project file directly using cmake_codeblocks.sh via CLI and then just use ‘make’ command to build it directly. Building it via C::B should not be of any difference but I don’t have it installed on my VM. Conclusion: there is something else causing your project file generation failure.</p>

<p>I think I’ve made a “stupid” error LOL!  <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/c16ddadcbd525aa6d219a1df596d362f.png" title=":smiley:"/></p>
<p>Done the CLI command and it worked. Then checked why it was failing with the FRONTEND GUI: I was creating the build in a directory <span class="bbcode-u">that has spaces in the name</span>: “URHO 3D BUILD”.<br/>
I just changed the folder name to “URHO_3D_BUILD” then the configure command worked perfectly!</p>
<p>I think it could have worked with the 4.8 compiler, it’s just that my build folder name had spaces in it! Thanks weitjong! You helped me a lot figure this out!</p>

<p>Good to hear that. The setup for PCH need to invoke the compiler at the time CMake is configuring and generating the Urho3D project file. So, most of the time it was the first error one would encounter when there were some problems with the compiler toolchain or build tree. Those problems may or may not be related to PCH. In the past before we have this PCH thingy, CMake would generate the project file silently despite those problems and user would only know about them much later after trying to build the project. By invoking the compiler early on, we get an early sign.</p>
