<p>I’ve got an example that I am trying to wrap up. The last step is the ability to pick a shader define with a drop down.</p>
<p>The first method that I tried, was to change the pixelShaderDefine on the renderpathcommand. I didnt get any errors, but it didnt have an effect.<br/>
It looks as though I can not just set the pixelShaderDefines on the renderpathcommand. I can read it, just not set it, though the docs do not say that it is read only.</p>
<p>The second method, was to rebuild an entire renderpathcommand. Remove the original one, and add the new one. That seems to have an effect, however, I only get a black screen. But I can print out the values, and everything seems fine. Assuming that its the last command of three on the renderpath.<br/>
This method. I remove command[2], build a new renderpathcommand ( RenderPathCommand rpc = RenderPathCommand(); ), and fill in the relevant values. and set it ( renderer.viewports[0].renderPath.AddCommand(rpc); ). After removing I can Print I have 2 commands, add it, I can print I have 3.</p>
<p>Is there a command that I need to send to tell it to recompile the shader?</p>
<p>Thanks for any insight into how I might be able to achieve this if its possible.</p>

<p>I think you’re hitting a stupidity of the AngelScript bindings related to a value type such as the RenderPathCommand, and accessors.</p>
<p>Try making a copy of the renderpathcommand, change the defines on the copy, then set the command back.</p>
