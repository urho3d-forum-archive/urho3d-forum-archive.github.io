<p>Hello, I’m porting an app to urho and I’d like someone to consider on the following.</p>
<p>In my old architecture I’m using EntityX. This is a pure ECS, where components are just data, and systems are function which operates on that data.<br/>
I’m trying to relate this to Urho. In Urho, nodes are containers, and components looks like a specialization of nodes, where one node becames a skybox, a model, and so on.<br/>
Then there are logic components, which looks like a behavioural specialization of components.</p>
<p>My app is based on a specialized form of flocking. I have a group of nodes which acts as a whole, moved by specialized path functions, sort of screen-walking sprites grouped together and creating harmonies and disharmonies.</p>
<p>Until now, I’ve put all these things into the update cycle and manage everything from a generalized form of AI over data management.</p>
<p>To my understanding, in urho I should:</p>
<ul>
<li>transform the whole group in different nodes under a group parent node;</li>
<li>create related sprites components</li>
<li>put all the flocking AI into the parent logic component</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, part of ECS is used as a FSM game manager for level AI. Is this to be managed as a subsystem? To my understanding, subsystems are application-wide objects so that’d like to be its place… but not sure about it.</p>
<p>Can someone share its thought about?</p>
