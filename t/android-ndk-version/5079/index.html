<p>Latest question before going in a meeting to decide which engine use for our newer projects.</p>
<p>We release a lot of game for android using NDK i read in the forum someone that says we may use 15c.</p>
<p>I did a fast test using latest ndk and i got a clang.exe error, so i have to ask it.<br/>
Which version of ndk should be used?</p>

<p>The latest recommended approach for Android build is to use “embedded” NDK-bundle from Android SDK, instead of using standalone NDK.</p>

<p>I had a little problem with an already known issue… (cmd.exe command too long) but i guess i fixed it by manually change the build.ninja files.<br/>
It was annoying but necessary.<br/>
Basically when a string is longer than 7800 char i cut the string and save in a file in the same directory and leave at its place this kind of command:<br/>
POST_BUILD = cmd.exe /C azafix6.txt</p>
<p>This seems did the trick.</p>

<p>Just wonder how many places you need to patch it. IMHO, this is a bug in the CMake/ninja generator when it is generating on Windows 10 host system. The bug does not appear when it is generating on Windows 7 host system, i.e. it knows when to use the response file correctly. To make it worse, the Android plugin for Gradle uses its own embedded <code>CMake</code> from the Android SDK and not the standalone <code>CMake</code> installed on the host system. Thus, upgrading the latter does not fix this issue. Someone should log this issue to Google Android dev team or at least bring the attention to the dev who has the bright idea of forking CMake inside the Android SDK package.</p>

<p>There’s a renowned cmake bug on Android running since something 3.0x to 3.9 I think, I can’t recall exactly, but I can check my notes if you need. So there’s no escaping using embedded Android cmake, which, in turn, has got “optimized” for the platform so that it “overperforms”, for instance while building ninja/cmake, and… well you got the picture.</p>

<p>I can probably understand why they need to do that quickly at the time. It may seem to be a good idea to fork and fix the bug in-house and shipped it as part of their package. Hey, even we do that with our 3rd-party libs. The problem is, their CMake version appears to stay at 3.6.4111459 while the upstream has moved beyond that version with new improvement on its side too. Anyway, that’s not my point of bringing this up. My point is, their embedded (read “optimized”) CMake/ninja generator does not do its job well and they probably don’t know it yet.</p>

<p>Here i am!<br/>
Well to be honest i don’t know yet, i was compiling it when i was in office friday evening and i went home.<br/>
I will let you know on monday if everythings went fine.<br/>
Anyway i’ll try to explain what the cause is and how we could do the fix (if mine did not work).</p>
<p>Basically ninja create some files named build.ninja those file try to call “cmd.exe /C (path)” where path is a long string.<br/>
What is the problem?<br/>
The problem is that cmd.exe can only handle 8192 char in 64 bit or 2100 and something in 32bit.<br/>
Microsoft suggest to use shorter name (fuck you microsoft) or use a txt file with the parameters on it as for example:<br/>
cmd.exe /c file.txt</p>
<p>So i did a very annoying job, i got every build.ninja file that was generated and manually scroll searching line longer than 7900 char.<br/>
I found that eventually those are 4-5 line per arm.<br/>
BE CAREFULL if you do this, modify only the line with cmd.exe.<br/>
There are other long lines but those has no any problem.<br/>
I cut off the text from there and create a txt file in the same path, and add the filename.txt where i removed the line.</p>
<p>I know it’s quite difficoult to follow, also i am not english native so this is even worst!<br/>
Let me know!</p>

<p>You don’t need to explain the root cause again because it is a known issue already to us. I just want to know how many places you need to patch it. If it is only a few of them and I can get a regex pattern to isolate them then I can probably cook up a post-cmake step *.batch file similar to what we have in “script/.bash_helpers.sh” to auto-patch the generated build tree. The thing is, I don’t have Windows 10 at home so I cannot get this information myself. I don’t work with Urho3D while I am at office.</p>

<p>If you can share it here where we can all see it, sure, although I actually not sure what you meant by “standard cmake/ninja”. I just do whatever it takes to make my build works and I did the Urho3D build migration to Gradle without copying from others. <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/7bdd5ab4d67675d002d99e4b948c8cdb.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>

I think i did it… It’s compiling all the sample right now so i am not totally sure but i never reached this point!</p>
<p>I am not sure why but even if i installed the newer version of cmake android studio keep using the older one. So i decide to force it and it went good.</p>
<p>You can force android studio to use the new cmake version by editing the local.properties in the engine root and add:<br/>
cmake.dir=c:\Path\To\Android_Studio\cmake\3.10.2.4988404</p>
<p>You could also force the unmodified version of cmake there, but i am not sure how android studio will react to that.</p>

<p>I can confirm that… then it is hard-wired inside the Android plugin for Gradle. <img alt=":man_facepalming:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/14cbde319508c98517aa7636debe9264.png" title=":man_facepalming:"/> But if this is the case then other peoples will face it too.

<p>Just did a quick search this morning. I think it is because the Android plugin still defaulted to the lower version, but it should be configurable in our build script, to explicitly specify the version number we want to use. Later I will try to configure that and test. Incidentally I have a new dev branch <code>gradle-upgrade</code> which also exhibits the same issue insisting on re-downloading the older version.</p>

<p>Ok so yesterday i build the engine.<br/>
When i try to launch the apk i got an error:<br/>
Createprocess command too long…<br/>
So now is ninja that fails…</p>
<p>In any cases the apk is created…<br/>
So probably we cannot run the apk directly from android studio but we can create it (create apk command, will test it and let you know).<br/>
As far as i know when you click run in android studio it did not create an apk it will compose the resources and install all on the phone, so this problem may be not an issue.</p>
<p>Apk did not work and the fault here is that MKLINK did not work (assets are empry except for the links).<br/>
I will copy the resources there and try to create the apk again.</p>
<p>We use cocos2dx often and they simply use a task to copy the resources when you build to android, maybe this will fix the issue for every users?</p>

<p>I understand your frustration. That’s why it is a long outstanding known issue. There is little thing we could do on our side as the issue is not in our build script.</p>
<p>The good news is, I figure out how to keep the older CMake version out. The launcher-app seems to be running fine in a quick emulator test run after a clean rebuild using CMake 3.10.2. I will push that out shortly.</p>

<p>There should be a way to “limit the issue” but i know it will be very annoying.<br/>
Basically it’s crashing because the linking is too long, reducing drastically the folder/subfolder MAY be reduce the problem.<br/>
Most of the file which cause the issue are the third part library.</p>
<p>But i know it’s just a temporary fix, since adding more library will cause the issue to reapper.</p>

<p>I will be merging my <code>gradle-upgrade</code> dev branch to master soon after the latest round of CI build passed. Finger cross. The changes include specifically requested Android Plugin to use the latest CMake version. Now I don’t know whether the Ninja generator in this latest version has fixed this particular issue or not, but I think it should worth your while to retry one more time.</p>

<p>Someone else try that in the past and, if I recall it right, didn’t report back with good news. At one time I also believe WSL could work too, but then again if it is not fully tested then there are bound for small issues.

<p>Our builds are IDE-agnostics. In fact it can be built just by using Gradle wrapper on a command line. Unless you wanted to say you actually having a problem with Android Studio after the Grade version upgrade, which I doubt as I have tested it to be working fine with IntelliJ IDEA. The way I understood it, both IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio simply rely on the Gradle to do the actual build. So, there is no different than invoking the Gradle manually in command line. If it works then it works everywhere (on *NIX).</p>

<p>Let me upgrade my Android Studio to 3.3.2 and test. The reason I want to bump the Gradle version from 4.9 to 5.x is because the <code>kotlin-dsl</code> release 1.0 is only made available on Gradle 5.x. The 4.9/4.10 only provides the RC version. One of the goal when I did the build system migration from Ant is to not just migrating to Gradle, but to also to use its latest DSL using Kotlin script rather than the legacy Groovy script. And I have been waiting for that 5.x release for quite some time now.</p>

<p>Bummer. I got the same message as yours. The 3.5.0 is required and the preview is available here <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/preview" rel="nofollow noopener">https://developer.android.com/studio/preview</a>. I think you can revert back the Gradle upgrade commit but keep the one which upgrade the embedded CMake version for now, if you cannot use the Preview version.</p>
