<p>Hello, I am just getting into Urho3D and am tring to set up the engine. I am building Urho3D on a Linux OS (Debian 32-bit). I have been following along with the documentation and the tutorial on the Urho3D wiki regarding what I need to have installed in terms of dependencies. I am encountering an issue when I try to build using cmake_generic.sh with -DURHO3D_SAMPLES=1. I am able to successfully run the following:</p>
<p><code>$ cd $URHO3D_REPOSITORY
$ ./cmake_generic.sh $URHO3D_HOME [variable list]</code><br/>
But the next step is where it falls apart. After changing to $URHO3D_HOME and running make, the build compilation continues until about 50%. This result appears as follows:</p>
<p><code>

<p>After navigating through the source code, it appears there is no “angelscript.h” in the AngelScript directory. I tried once more, building with URHO3D_ANGELSCRIPT set to 1, but the documentation says this should be so by default.</p>
<p>To clarify, I made sure to install all the dependencies I did not have that were described at the beginning of the tutorial. I have also tried the information provided in the<span class="bbcode-b"> Urho3D Install Tips and Tricks</span>, although to no avail. My best guess is that I am not installing the proper dependencies for 32-bit?</p>

<p>Hey arrowhart,</p>
<p>Welcome to the forums <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/7bdd5ab4d67675d002d99e4b948c8cdb.png" title=":slight_smile:"/> Yes, pretty much the same in all platforms with CMake scripts and Angelscript is indeed enabled by default.</p>
<p>Just invoke this: <span class="bbcode-b">./cmake_generic.sh ./build</span> where ‘build’ is your makefile and binaries directory.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Edit:</span> As for the Samples build option, I think this is also enabled by default for some reason, which is weird and some sort of a small issue going on, at least with my recent builds.</p>

<p>Just did this one earlier in my ubuntu 14.04 32bit using vbox.</p>
