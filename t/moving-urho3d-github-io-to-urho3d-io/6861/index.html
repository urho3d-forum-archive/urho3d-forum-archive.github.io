<p>This is the thing that we should have done it a few years ago, but we did not because the person who maintaining the gh-pages and the person who owning the domain name was not the same person. While investigating this unrelated <a href="https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/dnssec-issue-with-forum/6810">issue</a> recently, I find that it is just a few clicks away to link the two together. At this juncture of the Urho3D project life, this does not really matter much, but at the very least it saves you a few key strokes to access the main site <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/7bdd5ab4d67675d002d99e4b948c8cdb.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>

<p>The DNS updates propagate faster than I thought. I still have to do a search and replace everywhere in our docs to use “<code>urho3d.io</code>” consistently. While I am at it, I may “refresh” the gh-pages with a newer static site generator technology. Don’t hold your breath for it though.</p>
<p>EDIT: completed the migration setup on “Google Search Console” and “Google Analytics” too. Let’s hope we keep the SEO ranking.</p>

<p>So, I have started working on a new website using ReactJS and Docusarus 2. In order to speed up the work, I will reuse the existing content from the old website as much as possible and will use some of the screenshots from the Showcase category in the forums as new assets. For the screenshots as new assets, I assume I am allowed and has permission to do that. However, if this is not the case then the copyright owner of the screenshot can just inform me and I will substitute it immediately. Obviously I will only choose those that are relevant to Urho3D <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/7bdd5ab4d67675d002d99e4b948c8cdb.png" title=":slight_smile:"/>, but I haven’t started choosing any yet. On the other hand, if you want the screenshots from your new game to be featured/showcase in the website, you can also PM me with the relevant material.</p>
<p>My plan is to release the new website progressively over the next few weeks, migrating the content from the old Jekyll site to the new one bit by bit, instead of one big bang like the one I did many years ago. It was the Jekyll site that we use till today.</p>

<p>I have been very careful about that. In fact all the old links that people have around the internet will still be able to get served correctly. I will minimize the number of broken links. In fact the whole legacy website is still there, what really got changed so far is the “index.html” page with all the magic of React hydration in the background. In short, currently the website is in the hybrid mode.</p>

<p>Users will still be able to generate the API doc using Doxygen locally. However, they can’t generate the “website” locally, that looks like the final one on <code>urho3d.io</code>. That’s the drawback with my decision to make the builder a private repo, which I am willing to take. However, the online website will be PWA when I am done with my work, so it can be “installed” locally and read offline. So, I hope that addresses your concern.</p>
<p>Getting the website code (builder) closed source is to protect us from having multiple website clones later on. The code is also my own copyright. It is totally up to me whether to license it for others or not. If you hire a dedicated website designer to develop the website, you will probably get the same deal. You got the result deployed somewhere but not the code.</p>

<p>Curve balls are thrown at particular decisions. If you can not handle criticism and you think your decisions are always perfect… That explains state of things i guess. I am rather disappointed how your recent decisions never include users in equation. Dumping website on your users is not exactly nice. Or kotlin android cruft for that matter. This leaves urho in a weird state. It sort of is a public project that other people are supposed to use, but at the same time it is a personal playground for various (experimental) ideas, which does not play well into a public project description. This is where this confusion and irritation stems from.</p>
<p>P.S. seems to me you are the one swinging personal attacks at me the moment i start discussing technical points of some decisions. this sounds awfully a lot like <span class="mention">@Modanung</span> in gitter, which was lots of “no u troll” while continuously trolling.</p>

<p>Yeah, right. Why didn’t you start to give your bright idea on how to start to make thing better instead of just picking bones. For what I see, all you guys are protecting your own selfish interest. Less change on the main repo means less work on your fork. I got it.</p>

<p>Of course. This is what everyone does. Your decisions impact me as urho3d user therefore i speak out. Thing is, i believe things i push for are beneficial for other users as well.</p>

<p>This claim has no basis in reality. Urho3D recently got a ton of commits regarding automated AS bindings. This benefits me in no way. Whats worse - all headers got littered with extra comments aiding auto-binding process, creating me a ton of extra work when doing merges. I have no complaints about that, as this is a very reasonable feature to have if project supports AS. So if i am so selfish, why do i speak out about something that takes me three clicks to solve and remain silent about something that wasted considerably more of my time? Answer is: because website on the repo benefits nobody and is very out of place, while AS bindings are a valid feature benefit upstream users. I can see you hate my guts, but it would be nice if you at least criticized me based on my actions, not based on what you think of me personally.</p>

<p>Again, I have absolutely zero interest on what happening on your fork. So, just leave us alone. Cut the umbilical cord with the upstream Urho3D repo if you are so afraid of the changes. This will be the last time I will respond to you. Next time you post anything here that tries to derail this thread again, I will ban you from my forum.</p>

<p>We found more strange bugs that nobody ever complained about. Probably because nobody used those features. Same is true for android build system. I had enough problems with old gradle build system. Huge ecosystem behind it was enormously helpful troubleshooting all all kinds of stuff from weird gradle quirks to simple “how do i do xyz”. Now imagine going through the same ordeal, except using a new fresh-from-the-oven system which even was alpha at the time of integration to urho. The fact that nobody complains does not mean everything is good. Nobody complains about *** either. Because nobody uses it <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/94dd27e9c6c243335d29229e02e34e9d.png" title=":smiley:"/></p>

<p>Just want to update that the initial teething issues that I mentioned before should be now all fixed. The CI/CD workflow should be now smart enough to bail out cleanly when it detects non-code change. The website event dispatcher workflow on the other hand should only dispatch the build event when it detects there are changes to the website content. Both workflows will run to their full course when the change is a mix of code and content.</p>
<p>Now with this behind me, I could focus on writing the content. English is not my primary language, so I need all the help.</p>

<p>It is progressing slower than I expected. Aside from moving the old content over, I also need to “refresh” a few section to reflect the current state in the master branch especially on the build system side. The doc update did not take place at the time I completed the rewrite of the rakefile and the new CI using GH Actions.</p>
<p>I was also slow down by the fact that I need to develop the custom React components for our website as I go. It is fun, however. Don’t be surprised to see better integration with WASM samples, including the Urho3DPlayer, later.</p>
