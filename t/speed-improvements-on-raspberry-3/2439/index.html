<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Does anyone here have experience with Urho on Raspberry Pi?</p>
<p>We use Urho3D as the base of our solution running on a Raspberry Pi. As of now we use the Raspberry Pi 2, but have started to migrate towards Raspberry Pi 3.<br/>
Pi 3 has faster processor and faster memory, but the same graphics chip as its predecessor. Although the graphics chip run at a higher clock speed.<br/>
So far we have not been able to see any performance gain when it comes to frame rate in comparing v3 to v2.<br/>
Therefore I?m wondering if anyone have tried this and seen improvements? Are there perhaps any compiler flags we could play with?</p>
<p>There are articles to be found that report on around 25% frame rate increase in Quake 3 Arena on raspberry pi 3 compared to 2. That tells me that in theory one should be able to get some benefits from the new Pi, but I don?t know if this applies to Urho3d as well.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on this?<br/>
Cheres!</p>
