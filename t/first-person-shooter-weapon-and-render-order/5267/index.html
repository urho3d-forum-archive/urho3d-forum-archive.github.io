    I rather have the possibility of shadows on the weapon when clipping, than not being able to use shadows at all. I noticed Battlefield 3 has this behavior too. 
Z-offset seems like the way to achieve this behavior. I want to know and specify how much offset is needed (perhaps the total bounding box of all the viewport models). 
I wonder if codingmonkey’s method can work with urho, and what it takes to implement it? 

How does it compare to depth offset? It would make z-fighting more likely?

<p>but it is not clear to me how it was solved (enhex’s hellbreaker is fantastic).</p>
<p>My first attempt was to replicate the code proposed by enhex (I used actionscript) but SetRenderOrder still doesn’t work or I’m doing something wrong, in 18_CharacterDemo.as:CreateCharacter ()</p>
<pre><code>    Node @ xNode = characterNode.CreateChild ("test");
    xNode.scale = Vector3 (0.25f, 0.25f, 1.0f);
    xNode.position = Vector3 (0.5f, 0.9f, 1.5f);
    StaticModel @ xobject = xNode.CreateComponent ("StaticModel");
    xobject.model = cache.GetResource ("Model", "Models / Box.mdl");
    xobject.castShadows = true;
    // (is there a way in actionscript to use clone () without declaring two variables?)
    Material @ mat = cache.GetResource ("Material", "Materials / Jack2.xml");
    Material @ mat2 = mat.Clone ();
    mat2.renderOrder = 200;
    Technique @ tec = mat2.techniqueEntries [0] .technique;
    Technique @ tec2 = tec.Clone ();
    Pass @ pass = tec2.GetPass (tec2.passNames [0]);
    pass.depthTestMode = CMP_ALWAYS;
    xobject.material = mat2;
</code></pre>
<p>As a second attempt I duplicated the Material and the Technique, but I am not yet confident with the urho render pipeline and materials, I enabled DumpResources on exit and I see that the updated material and technique are used:</p>
<pre><code>Materials / Jack2.xml
Techniques / NoTexture2.xml
</code></pre>
<p>I see the shaders that are used:</p>
<pre><code>Shaders / GLSL / Shadow.glsl
Shaders / GLSL / LitSolid.glsl
Shaders / GLSL / Basic.glsl
</code></pre>
<p>it is not clear to me where to intervene to associate a custom shader to the Jack2 material (notexture has the attribute vs only for depth and shadow and depth is not even used ??)</p>
<p>I think the weapon is a fairly common requirement for a FPS, it would be nice to have a working example.</p>
<p><strong>edit</strong></p>
<p>Somehow I missed the fact that the notexture technique element has the vs attribute, I modified it and I see that the specified shader is loaded (Shaders / GLSL / LitSolid2.glsl)</p>
<p>I tried modifying VS with gl_Position.z * = 0.999 or gl_Position.z * = 0.01 but I don’t see changes, do I have to change anything else?</p>

<p>Hello, welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>Don’t use box model. Take any concave model and you will see the effect of CMP_ALWAYS, and why it is bad idea for this case, because the different parts of gun model will have totally broken z order.</p>
<p>gl_Position hacking works surprisingly fine. But I would expect some problems down the line with z-precision, lighting or particle effects for example.</p>
<p>Make sure you change z value before this line in LitSolid.glsl:</p>
<pre><code>vWorldPos = vec4(worldPos, GetDepth(gl_Position));
</code></pre>
<p>Because that’s the depth value that gets passed into pixel shader and then used for depth testing.</p>

<p>Best solution depends on exact renderpath and even post-effects you are using.</p>

<p>Hi Bananaft, thanks!</p>
<p>I’ve been following Urho3D for some time, I think it’s a fantastic engine and I finally found some free time to play with it. The documentation is good, I just wish there was a little more material about it (video tutorials, books?).</p>
<p>Back to the render order question, I didn’t edit the post but I made some progress by following the directions of cadaver, adding basefps to renderpath, adding renderorder to the materials and CMP_ALWAYS in some pass. The box behaved quite well in the FP cam, the only oddity I noticed was some flicker in the shadow it receives, I imagined it depended on the fact that I resized the box.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for confirming that instead the shader is the way to go and for the valuable advice, I will try with a decent model with multiple parts, and a shader with z value parameterized as suggested by gawag.</p>

<p>To be honest, what I’ve been thinking about for some time and I’d like to see is a FPS multiplayer SDK made with Urho, simple to mod, I’m a Bad Company 2 fan, I often wonder if Urho can achieve a similar result (I think so ).</p>

    Looking through the source code <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM-3-BFG/tree/master/neo">github.com/id-Software/DOOM-3-B … master/neo</a> I noticed that they use a strange method for rendering weapons that it does not permeate through the wall. I do not fully understand how it works, but it modifies the projection matrix. DepthHack also used for particles.

<p>Camera custom projection matrix should go in to master shortly, however this would require a per-object custom projection matrix (if we want to use shadows from the existing scene render) which can be somewhat unclean to get in. Ideas / PRs are welcome.</p>

<p>I had seen the DepthHack mentioned in the other thread but I hadn’t seen this specific thread nor the video, very interesting, thanks again.</p>
<p>Incredibly I had never seen this video on youtube even though I often searched for Urho3D video and having already found some 1vank videos (some time ago I created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHl6zjcEAbLOGMbFb46-RZcWf-LOXXKii" rel="nofollow noopener">Urho3D playlist</a>)</p>

<p><span class="mention">@Dave82</span>, some old FPS I saw used animated images, for the weapon in first person, but you still need a mask / alpha, at that point instead of a texture it would be enough to render it last. Personally at the moment I don’t know enough about Urho3D’s render pipeline for such an implementation, I don’t know if the challenge is to get the mask/alpha together with the light and shadows of the main scene.</p>
<p>I had to push the test of the weapon in the stack but I expect to go back to it soon and post some results.</p>
<p>P.S. : I have a series of stupid questions like “how could I do this …” or “would it be possible to do …”, what would be the best place to post them?</p>

<p>These forums will do, related followup questions can be asked in the same thread, but don’t hesitate to start a new one either. There’s also <a  rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Gitter</a>, and if you’re question is <em>really</em> stupid, just try formulating it more intelligently until it contains the answer (and then trim).
