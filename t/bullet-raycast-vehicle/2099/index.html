<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Recently came across this article <a href="http://discourse.urho3d.io/t/btraycastvehicle-example/1306/1">topic1354.html</a> . Author managed to implement raycast vehicle support for the urho3D. I succesfully managed to get it to work on linux systems but when I try to build the same thing on windows (visual studio), it throws “unresolved external symbol” errors for the bullet classes. Does anyone have any solution to this problem? Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I already had URHO3D_PHYSICS preprocessor defined but the problem still occurs.<br/>
Just to make it clearer, I tried  using Urho3D 1.5 prebuilt shared x32 and x64 windows versions.</p>

<p>Managed to find a workaround for this problem! I added prebuilt bullet libraries directly to my project configuration besides the Urho3D library, looks something like this:</p>
<p>Linker -&gt; Input -&gt; Additional dependencies:</p>
<p>For the x64 build:<br/>
C:\Users\Admin\DevWorkspace\bullet3-2.83.4\build64\lib\Release\BulletCollision.lib<br/>
C:\Users\Admin\DevWorkspace\bullet3-2.83.4\build64\lib\Release\BulletDynamics.lib<br/>
C:\Users\Admin\DevWorkspace\bullet3-2.83.4\build64\lib\Release\LinearMath.lib</p>
<p>For the x32 build:<br/>
C:\Users\Admin\DevWorkspace\bullet3-2.83.4\build\lib\Release\BulletDynamics.lib<br/>
C:\Users\Admin\DevWorkspace\bullet3-2.83.4\build\lib\Release\BulletCollision.lib<br/>
C:\Users\Admin\DevWorkspace\bullet3-2.83.4\build\lib\Release\LinearMath.lib</p>
<p>Built bullet library myself using CMake and VS 2013</p>
<p>I guess that the problem it that the bullet physics library is not directly accessible using Urho3D. Physics itself works when I use Urho3D wrapper, but when creating Bullet objects directly, I got the “unresolved external symbol” errors.</p>

<p>I’ve never used any prebuild libs, but I thought they include the default build options as described here <a data-bbcode="true" href="http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.5/_building.html">http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.5/_building.html</a>.  I find it strange that physics is not enabled.  Maybe someone in the community can give you more info about what flags are enabled for prebuilds.</p>
<p>Anyway, good to hear you found a work around.</p>

<p>I do not think the root cause of the problem was the physics being disabled. The “unresolved external symbol” means a required symbol is not found in the Urho3D library. Urho3D library can be built as either STATIC or SHARED type. Both have its own pros and cons, but I will not discuss them here. I just like to point out that STATIC library will have all the symbols from all the 3rd-party libraries included (whether the symbol is used or not), while SHARED library will only have the symbols from 3rd-party libraries that are used by Urho3D game engine code. I guess some how you have used STATIC lib type when targeting Linux platform and SHARED lib type for Windows platform?</p>
<p>Building and using 3rd-party library externally in this manner in the linking phase as the workaround for the above error is quite dangerous, IMHO. For one, the source code for the 3rd-party libraries (like Bullet) in our codebase may contain our own local patches. I suppose the workaround works because it makes linker resolves the missing symbol(s) from the externally pre-built lib. But what if the linker also resolves other symbols from it too or what if it ends up with duplicate global.</p>
<p>In this case, I would just use STATIC lib type as the “workaround”.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion, will definitely try out the static version of the lib. Will let you know about the results!</p>
