<p>Not exactly related to Urho3D but anyway…</p>
<p>I’m using StaticModel to render some terrain (basically derived from a heightmap), now I would like to add roads, fields and other stuff to the terrain/surface. I would like to carve/stitch the roads, so that there will be no geometry beneath the road causing z fighting and such. I dont want to have the roads slightly above the terrain and use offsetting.</p>
<p>What would be the easiest way to accomplish this?. I dont know of any clipping/cutting API in Urho3D, anyone done something similar using 3rd party libraries?</p>
<p>Another option would be to use some savvy shaders but thats beyond my capabilities!</p>

<p>Hi, welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>Do you want your roads to be static, always the same, or dynamic generated, by the game, and changable at runtime?</p>
<p>If first, you better just edit your mesh in 3d editor, and cut out the roads.</p>
<p>If second, you better look towards decals.</p>

<p>Edit: Oh wait, whoops. You are using a StaticModel. You should be able to edit a mesh though. I played around with creating meshes by code once but had some issues but it worked Urho wise. You could change or replace parts of your terrain with code created meshes.</p>
<p>If you would be using the normal terrain you could do this:<br/>
You can change the heightmap and splatting map of the terrain during runtime.</p>
<p>This code increases the height of the terrain under the camera Node:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">    IntVector2 v=terrain-&gt;WorldToHeightMap(cameraNode_-&gt;GetWorldPosition());
    Image* i=terrain-&gt;GetHeightMap();
    for(int x=-10;x&lt;10;x++)
        for(int y=-10;y&lt;10;y++)
            i-&gt;SetPixel(v.x_+x,v.y_+y,i-&gt;GetPixel(v.x_+x,v.y_+y)+Color(0.1,0.1,0.1));
    terrain-&gt;ApplyHeightMap();</code></pre>
<p>You could use such code to flatten the terrain where the road should be.</p>
<p>I also found code to change the splatting map but I’m not sure if it works, there may have been an issue:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">    Texture2D* t=(Texture2D*)terrain-&gt;GetMaterial()-&gt;GetTexture(TU_DIFFUSE);
    Color c(1,0.1,0.1);
    for(int x=-10;x&lt;10;x++)
        for(int y=-10;y&lt;10;y++)
            t-&gt;SetData(0,x,y,1,1,&amp;c);
    terrain-&gt;GetMaterial()-&gt;SetTexture(TU_DIFFUSE,t);</code></pre>
<p>Does that help you?</p>
<p>I don’t think the terrain can actually be cut (out of the box) to replace it with custom models. You would have to extend the code to allow that. Such a feature would really be useful though.</p>
<p>Also ApplyHeightMap or SetTexture may have had a performance impact. It could be fixed by updating not all terrain parts at once but I don’t know if that’s currently possible. Such a feature would really be useful though, too.</p>

<p>Thanks for your answers!</p>
<p>The roads will be generated runtime but i’m not aiming to get them changable.</p>
<p>The heightmap data is the dataset from SRTM (I will only use a part of it, not the whole globe), 3 arc sec so one triangle from the terrain is pretty large so there is no need for flattening where roads will be.</p>
<p>The heightmap is mapped to an earth size sphere (so the StaticModel is actually curved), its at/before this mapping I plan to cut out  roads/rivers and stuff (while it still is flat/2D). I found a library called clipper (<a href="http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper/documentation/Docs/_Body.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">angusj.com/delphi/clipper/do … /_Body.htm</a>) that seems to be able to do what I want, so I’m going to try that.</p>
