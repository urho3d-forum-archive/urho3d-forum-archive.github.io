<p>Hello, I don’t have any knowledge of dedicated server technology. I would like a service with a low monthly rate (&lt;$20).  I would also like little to no configuration other than uploading my urho dedicated game and running it.  I don’t expect many players and the game uses rpc’s instead of auto-replication.  Can anyone advise me as to which would be the best service? Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>Honestly I don’t really know anything about dedicated servers, but ive been browsing around and I got the impression that amazon offers quite cheap servers. Still someone who actually has experience and knowledge can give better answer. Also I have no idea about the storage size from amazon nor if there is bandwidth limit/limit for amount of connections, etc.</p>

<p>+1 For digital Ocean. I’ve been with them for over a year with my DEV server. Good documentation from them if you do need to configure something. Yoou will need to secure your server though, but again, easy documentation to get it done.</p>
