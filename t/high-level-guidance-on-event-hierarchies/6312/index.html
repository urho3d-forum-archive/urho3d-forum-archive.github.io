<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Today I am studying the overall structure of RunFrame(). Here is what I found, i.e. more or less everything the engine will or might do.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">- RunFrame
	- Timer::BeginFrame		//sends out the E_BEGINFRAME event, signaling the beginning of the frame
	- E_BEGINFRAME
		- Workqueue::HandleBeginFrame()
		- Input::HandleBeginFrame()
		- FileSystem::HandleBeginFrame()
		- Network::Update()
		- ResourceCache::HandleBeginFrame()
		- UI::HandleBeginFrame()				//for resetting cursor each frame

		note: the timer sets the event data that is passed to all 'RunFrame' updates
			- frame number: which frame is beginning
			- time step: how long ago did the previous frame start

	- PlayAudio				//turns on audio if engine turned it off in the previous frame, or if we went from minimized-&gt;full mode
				
	- Update 				//sends out a series of update events that organize update workflow
		- E_UPDATE
			- Scene::Update()
			- Material::HandleAttributeAnimationUpdate() 	//sometimes, not clear what situations
		- E_POSTUPDATE
		- E_RENDERUPDATE
			- Audio::Update()
			- Octree::Update()				//when in headless mode, manually update Octree
			- Renderer::Update()
			- Network::PostUpdate()
			- UI::RenderUpdate()
		- E_POSTRENDERUPDATE

	- Render 				//render the application to screen
		- Graphics::BeginFrame()
		- Renderer -&gt; Render()
		- UI -&gt; Render()
		- Graphics::EndFrame()

	- ApplyFrameRateLimit 	//timing magic
		- normal: the engine has a 'FrameTimer' that times frames... at engine initialization the timer is started, and then at the end of the first frame it is reset; the recorded value is the 'time step' between frames; at the same point in each frame the timer gets reset, ensuring very minimal clock losses; the actual gap between resetting the timer and the next 'E_BEGINFRAME' event should be on the order of nanoseconds unless the E_ENDFRAME event is abused by the programmer
		- real frame rate exceeds max frame rate: the minimum gap between frames hasn't been reached, so a real-time delay is inserted
		- real frame rate is below min frame rate: the maximum gap between frames has been exceeded; since it isn't possible to speed up the program execution, the frame rate is artificially slowed down; in other words, the time step is lowered to the max gap between frames; for example, even though 5 seconds have passed in the world, only 4 seconds will be recorded as elapsing in the program's world; in effect, the program will enter slow motion

		note: by default the time step recorded is a moving average of real timesteps, presumably as a low-pass filter on frame rates to mitigate jitter; however, I suspect when frame rates increase rapidly then the in-game physics will slow down, and vice versa

	- Timer::EndFrame		//sends out the E_ENDFRAME event, signaling the end of the frame
		- E_ENDFRAME
			- Graphics::DebugRenderer()
			- Input::HandleEndFrame() 		// only for 'EMSCRIPTEN' builds
			- Log::HandleEndFrame()

<p>From what I can tell, ‘first to subscribe is first to respond on event send; sender-specific responses all go before generic responses (objects only respond once to an event, and sender-specific responses will take precedence over general responses if the object has multiple subscriptions to the same event with different senders [or no sender])’ according to the use of <code>EventReceiverGroup</code>. This means in the main update cycle, if a scene was initialized before any application objects subscribed to <code>E_UPDATE</code>, the scene will respond to <code>E_UPDATE</code> first before those other subscribers. Of course, a scene can technically be initialized anywhere.</p>
<p>I suppose my question is about best practices around order sequences of responses. If order matters, is it best to use different events that are sent sequentially? Should I assume all responses to an event could be randomly sequenced? Is there ever a situation where it is reasonable to use subscription order to control response order?</p>
<p>I’d love to hear anyone’s thoughts on how to fit the structure of an application into the engine’s workflow.</p>

<p>Yes. You may need to add some intermediate events if existing are not enough.<br/>
I wish we had something like update graph for both scene and global subsystems, but we don’t.</p>

<p>Yes. Order may or may not be preserved now, but it is not reliable behaviour.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="mention">@Eugene</span>. I was also wondering, it seems some engines implement a fixed-timestep internal loop within the frame loop for more streamlined physics. Is there a reason Urho3D did not implement that internal loop? I suppose it wouldn’t be unreasonably hard to implement one locally if necessary.</p>

<p>Maybe this is a dumb question… it seems like most or all event handlers are implemented like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">void HandleEvent(StringHash eventType, VariantMap &amp;eventData);
</code></pre>
<p>I’m wondering why is eventData not made <code>const</code>? If order-based event handling isn’t safe, then there shouldn’t be any situation where modifying <code>eventData</code> is safe or sensical. So, it would seem to want <code>const</code> always. Except maybe to pass information back to the sender… but even so that would be a rare exception for removing <code>const</code>, not a standard practice.</p>
<p>EDIT: Apparently <code>operator[]() const</code> for <code>HashMap</code> returns a pointer, while non-const returns a reference. Either way it is write access…</p>

<ol>
<li>It is <em>impossible</em> to implement safe <code>operator []</code> for constant dictionary in C++, if it returns value (=not pointer/optional/whatever). And value access via <code>[]</code> is convinient in most scenarios.</li>
<li>If you know there is only one event recepient, it’s fine to return values via event data.</li>
<li>Even if you know there may be multiple event recepients, it’s fine to return values via event data, as long as you know what you are doing.</li>
<li>And (1) or (2) is basically the only way you can possibly get feedback from event if you need it.</li>
</ol>
<p>It pretty much forces events to accept mutable event data.</p>
