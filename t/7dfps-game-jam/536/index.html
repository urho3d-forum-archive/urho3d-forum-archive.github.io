<p>hey</p>
<p>Two Game Jams, <a data-bbcode="true" href="http://7dfps.com" rel="nofollow noopener">7DFPS</a> and <a data-bbcode="true" href="http://itch.io/jam/procjam" rel="nofollow noopener">Procedural Generation Jam 2014</a>, are starting tomorrow.<br/>
I want to participate in one of these two. The last few weeks i had no time to do some programming but next week i have some free time to do so. <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/ab33f6c546ca85e7d84a4e3c32cd4034.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>
<p>Are there others, who have some interest to work together or just meet in an irc chat or so ?</p>

<p>Hm, they both sound like good jams – 7DFPS, a chance to try make something unique about FPS’s, ProcGen also includes tools as entries.</p>
<p>Does 7DFPS have a theme ?</p>
<p>If I do enter I might go solo, but it would be cool to bounce ideas around. I am in the <span class="hashtag">#urho3d</span> irc channel on freenode if you want to talk !</p>

<p>In the end I wasn’t able to finish to a quality I wanted, although since I like the idea I was working on I’ll definitely continue it at some point (it’s something I was bouncing around in my head for a while).</p>
<p>I posted screenshots and blab here: <a data-bbcode="true" href="http://hdsanctum.com/post/102640015676/i-didnt-get-my-7dfps-entry-to-a-standard-that-i" rel="nofollow noopener">Blog</a></p>

<p>[quote]- Inheritance in scripts can trip you up. Node::GetScriptObject only grabs explicitly named script objects, so if “Bot” inherits from “Player” you’re not going to find bot by looking for player. However, it was a natural enough choice to split the “Bot” away from the “Player” with the bot using the “Player” to make decisions. I think there’s still some remnants of the “OR OR OR” nightmares.<br/>

<p>Thats a good point, script instance was never improved even though script file lets you create objects via their interfaces now. I’ll add it to the todo list.</p>
