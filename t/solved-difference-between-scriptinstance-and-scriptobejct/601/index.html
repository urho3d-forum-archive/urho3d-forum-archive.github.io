<p>NEW QUESTION----------------------------------------<br/>
What is the difference between script object and a script instance.<br/>
I was trying to remove the script object on a node, but I changed that to instance, since I had set it up that way in the editor on my imported node.<br/>
My next step is going to bre reapplying a script instance to a child node. Which might be wrong. But I wanted to ask.</p>
<p>I succedded in remove the instance. But when i apply a new script obejct, can it be removed in the same way?</p>
<p>OLD QUESTION----------------------------------------<br/>
Trying to remove script obejct from a node with angelscript.<br/>
The node doesnt seem to have a method to handle it.<br/>
And the docs on ScriptObect list nothing.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to get the script object, then just call Remove().<br/>
As well a called node.RemoveComponent() with the script object, and the string. “ScriptObject”.<br/>
but im not entirely sure that that string is right.<br/>
So far I have not succedded in remove it.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is just me but it is not clear what you are asking or trying to achieve. The subject is quite clear though, so I just try to answer that. The ScriptObject is a class you defined in AngelScript or Lua scripting language. While the ScriptInstance (or LuaScriptInstance for Lua) is the component that contains a single instance of the ScriptObject class. The relationship between a ScriptObject class to a ScriptInstance component is like a mesh model to a StaticModel component.</p>

<p>Thank you. That’s what I kind of figured. I wanted to be sure.</p>
<p>I’m currently trying to change the script object on a script instance and was trying to understand what was happening to determine how to go about it.</p>
<p>Currently I am able to remove the script instance on the node. But I’m not sure that is the right way.</p>
<p>Basically I’m thinking about about a weapon pickup that changes the weapon and weapon behavior.</p>
<p>I’m able to everything so far but change the script object. I’ve tried to use the script instance CreateObject. But that doesn’t seem to work. But now I think it is because I am in separate classes and the scriptFile object isn’t right   (I’ve had that issue and solution pointed out to me before. I need to reference that thread)</p>

<p>For completion sake:<br/>
I solved my issue, and it was another case of user error. What i ended up doing:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Node@ n = otherObject.get_node();
Node@ weapon = n.children[0];

//change the static model
StaticModel@ sm = weapon.GetComponent("StaticModel");
sm.model = cache.GetResource("Model", "Models/Cone.mdl");

//change the weapons scriptobject
ScriptInstance@ si = weapon.GetComponent("ScriptInstance");
si.CreateObject(scriptFile,"NewWeapon");</code></pre>
