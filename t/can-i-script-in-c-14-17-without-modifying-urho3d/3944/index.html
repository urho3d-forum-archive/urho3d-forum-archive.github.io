<p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>I’m using Linux and a text editor for my C++ developments…</p>
<p>I’m somewhat new to C++ in general but I have been studying C++14 and am considering just skipping straight to C++17.</p>
<p>Here’s what I want to do:</p>
<p>I want to keep Urho3D 1.7 just the way it is and not change a thing.</p>
<p>I want to create my own “from scratch” .cpp files in my own folder.</p>
<p>Then when I compile; I want to compile Urho3D 1.7 but have the compiler also compile “my” c++ code.</p>
<p>My C++ code would basically be accessing and using Urho3D 1.7 but 100% from my own .cpp files and I want to use Urho3D in this way but the end result would basically be a c++ scripting instead of using lua or angelscript.</p>
<p>My biggest thing is that I want to use c++14 or c++17 in my own files if at all possible.</p>
<p>** If I can’t then my fall back would be to use Lua but I prefer to go c++</p>
<p>I hope this makes sense what I’m asking…</p>

One tried it, but it’s not very viable.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@TrevorCash</span> and I have been working on a live C/C++ platform built with (and for) Urho. It is still pretty rough from a workflow perspective but the live code side of things is working super well. I definitely think that dynamic scripting with C/C++ is the way to go!</p>
<p>Here is quick screencast. Still a WIP!</p>

<p><span class="mention">@ucmRich</span> First of all, your use of the word <code>scripting</code> in the context of C++ might be interpreted wrong by some people. Since C++ is a compiled language, people tend to use the therm <code>programming</code>. And <code>scripting</code> is mostly used for interpreted languages like python, php, javascript or lua and angelscript for that matter.</p>
<p>And if I follow these rules, then I’ll interpret your question as: You want to compile Urho with either regular C++ or C++11 but you’d like to use C++14/17 in your source files. And you can totally do that if you want to. Urho shouldn’t have any issues with it.</p>
<p>This becomes a bit harder to do when you want to do it from the build system. Since I haven’t seen an option with which standard you want to choose. Just pick whether you want C++11. Which means you’ll have to modify a few files to get that working.</p>
<p>And based on the other information you gave. I assume you want to have your files be compiled by Urho’s build system. For that, you might want to give this a read: <a href="https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.7/_using_library.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.7/_using_library.html</a></p>
<p>I found Urho to be really easy to switch to another way of building. For example. I made a Code::Blocks project that I use to build it. Since it makes it easier for me to debug. I know it sounds dumb but I got used to this workflow (<a href="https://s13.postimg.org/r6e0qi1br/Untitled.png" rel="nofollow noopener">https://s13.postimg.org/r6e0qi1br/Untitled.png</a>).</p>

<p>I was also confused by the term “script” here but, IIUC, I have been asking myself the same thing for a while. Actually I posted a question in stackoverflow for this: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46746878/is-it-safe-to-link-c17-c14-and-c11-objects" rel="nofollow noopener">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46746878/is-it-safe-to-link-c17-c14-and-c11-objects</a></p>
<p>There is no answer yet and it is still unclear to me, but discussion in comments suggests that</p>
<ul>
<li>there is no guarantee in the standard about this, it is up to compilers</li>
<li>it is probably ok, but still a risk</li>
</ul>
<p>So <span class="mention">@S.L.C</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Urho shouldn’t have any issues with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not Urho, but the linker might, unless your compiler’s documentation states otherwise.</p>
<p>Personally I am still sticking to C++11 for the moment. To move to C++17, I would customize Urho’s cmake modules to compile it with the same option to avoid risks.</p>
