<p>I was walking through the callstacks and found that there is a <em>LOT</em> of checks in View::UpdateGeometries that do little.  It is a fairly cheap function overall compared to the overall callstack, but adding a few more cache’s (or maybe an Event or two depending on how fast that call process is) could cut out a <em>lot</em> of the tests.  Specially in my scene I am noticing on line 1179 the loop of <code>for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; renderPath_-&gt;commands_.Size(); ++i)</code> are testing all of the renderPaths for if <code>(!IsNecessary(command))</code> and <code>if (command.type_ == CMD_SCENEPASS)</code>, wouldn’t it be better to have a dedicated cache/vector for the ones that fullfill these that are updated as necessary instead of looping?  This one overall is trivial though, the big one that had a lot of hits on my scene was on line 1219 the loop of <code>for (PODVector&lt;Drawable*&gt;::Iterator i = geometries_.Begin(); i != geometries_.End(); ++i)</code> loops over all geometries, of which there are quite a <em>lot</em>, but it just tests for either <code>if (type == UPDATE_MAIN_THREAD)</code> or <code>else if (type == UPDATE_WORKER_THREAD)</code>, yet all of them in my scene are UPDATE_NONE, so it is looping needlessly.</p>
<p>Just a notice I had, it is still very little time compared to, say, just clearing the screen, but it looks like a simple optimization that could potentially give a noticeable boost, though tests would say for sure instead of just guessing.  <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/ab33f6c546ca85e7d84a4e3c32cd4034.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>

<p>Looping the renderpath commands even several times should basically be negligible, and it doesn’t grow with the number of scene objects.</p>
<p>The question of looping through the geometries to find out how they’re updated is a good one, that can possibly be moved as part of the base pass gathering.</p>
<p>Generally, a profiler like CodeAnalyst will know best the code hotspots.</p>
<p>EDIT: after going through the code, I cannot in good conscience move the geometry’s update type check earlier. It’s probably something that would never effect 99.9% of cases, but there’s the odd possibility that due to some interaction, eg. when an object is viewed from multiple views, it would first return being OK with a threaded update, but later (close to rendering) it would actually decide it needs a main thread update, for example updating its vertex buffer. In that case, if we had already determined it to want a threaded update and went with that, we’d crash. It has to be noted that it would be a nice optimization, because in the HugeObjectCount sample I see the SortAndUpdateGeometry block to take 0.5 ms, which cannot be called negligible anymore. That scene has 62500 objects though, so it’s an extreme case.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: by re-checking threaded updated drawables (there should be very few of them) just before they’re put to the threaded queue, the optimization should be safe.</p>
