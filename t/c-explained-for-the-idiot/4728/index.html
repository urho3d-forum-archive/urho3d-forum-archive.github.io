<p>Anyone have a C++ explanation/tutorial/whatever else for someone like me who is an artist that pretty much only knows very basic C# and Angel Script? I want to do some VERY minor mods to the engine and in order to do that I need to be able to understand what it is I’m doing.</p>

<p>It’s like C# with <code>unsafe</code> 100% of the time. You’ll need to get used to having to use both <code>.</code> and <code>-&gt;</code> depending on how something was allocated and depending on what you’re working with. Access control (protected private) is <em>sticky</em> instead of attached to each declaration and you’ve now got the joy of header files.</p>
<p>If you’re using a new version of VS with the type search (default CTRL+T) that super helpful to new people and people new to a project - lets you easily track anything down by name.</p>

<p>There are also C++ examples that are mostly all implemented to match the general structure of the angelscript/lua examples. Those should be useful for you to be able to reference what something in angelscript looks like in C++ for first porting (then improving) your AS controller to C++.</p>
<p>I believe there’s a version of the NinjaSnowWar demo rewritten in C++ floating around somewhere that you might be able to track down, that should be similar to the examples as well.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <a href="https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/ninja-snow-war-c-version/2729">Ninja snow war C++ is over in this thread</a>, it does look to be a little behind the times though.</p>
<p>Unfortunately you have to pretty much just muscle through, read a few C++ crash courses (if you can find any you can stand to read, most I’ve seen are terrible), and ask when you’re jammed up.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, that’s a shader (unless wanting bent-normals from vertex data - not likely you want that though).</p>
