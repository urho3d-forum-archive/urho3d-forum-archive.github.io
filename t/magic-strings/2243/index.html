<p>So I recently downloaded a fresh copy of Urho from master, and I wanted to separate the Editor from everything else spread through-out the Data folder, into it’s own directory (so I could keep the editor, but remove everything else not relevant to my project). It’s a bit of a PITA, but with some patience and find &amp; replace I got it properly working again. Except for one (little) thing.</p>
<p>I was getting an error in the console when starting the editor: (actually, gives this twice)</p>
<p><code>ERROR: Could not find resource UI/ScreenJoystick.xml
ERROR: Count not find inherited XML file: UI/ScreenJoystick.xml
ERROR: Could not find resource UI/ScreenJoystickSettings.xml
ERROR: Count not find inherited XML file: UI/ScreenJoystickSettings.xml</code></p>
<p>So I go looking for a reference in the Editor’s angelscript code for [color=#800040]UI/ScreenJoystick.xml[/color]. Couldn’t find one. So I do a search in the Urho C++ source. And sure enough, there is a hardcoded reference to [color=#800040]UI/ScreenJoystick.xml[/color] in Input.cpp, in AddScreenJoystick(). Well, that doesn’t seem ideal. But I wasn’t going to bother with changing it and recompiling the player, etc. So I do a search in the editor’s code for a call to AddScreenJoystick (since it is literally the only place referencing that damn joystick file). I was unable to find a single call to it. Strange. Clearly <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">something</span></span> must be calling AddScreenJoystick <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">somewhere</span></span>… After abusing my ctrl and f keys a bit, I grew frustrated and gave up. Fortunately those messages only presents a minor annoyance. Still felt it was worthwhile to point out these string’s existences.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">TL;DR</span><br/>
<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">MAGIC STRINGS</span></span><br/>
Input.cpp [color=#800040]“UI/ScreenJoystick.xml”[/color] (in AddScreenJoystick(…))<br/>
MessageBox.cpp [color=#800040]“UI/MessageBox.xml”[/color] (in constructor)</p>
<p>In both cases, the method in question has a parameter XMLFile* layoutFile, and does a check. When the check fails it loads the file specified in the magic string. In both cases there is an assumption made that those directories and files will exist in a user’s Data directory, which may not be the case at all.</p>
<p>There are a few similar magic strings in the source for the Graphics system, but those refer to the RenderPaths / Technique folders inside the CoreData directory, the existence of which seems like a reasonable assumption.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I don’t know the best approach for removing them. If I did I would just make a pull request. Maybe something along the lines of a config file that specifies these locations, and the config file itself would be in the CoreData folder?</p>

<p>You could think of those files as “CoreData” for the UI / Input and they could as well be moved to CoreData. This hardcoding isn’t IMO more egregious than the hardcoding of a default renderpath or default spot light attenuation texture, and are needed for the features in question.</p>
