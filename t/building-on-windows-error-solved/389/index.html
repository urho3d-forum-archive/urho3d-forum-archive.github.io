<p>I normally use linux and dont have these issues. But I am trying to build on windows for whatever reason.<br/>
What I’ve done so far, is run cmake_mingw.bat<br/>
then i’ve installed cingw files with make. And run make in the build directory</p>
<p>I immediatly get this error:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[  0%] Building CXX object ThirdParty/Box2D/CMakeFiles/Box2D.dir/Box2D/Collision

<p>google is telling me to modify the makefile basically. But I wanted to consult the forums first. Maybe I am just missing something in mingw</p>

<p>cingw? Is that a typo? Anyway, we only support MinGW-W64. Only this variant of MinGW is being tested everyday on our CI build on a Linux build system. I have not booted into my Windows partition in months now so I have not built Urho3D there for a while but I reckon MinGW-W64 would also work well with Urho3D on a Windows build system.</p>

<p>It looks like you have so old MinGW that it doesn’t recognize the options that current MinGW’s need to avoid depending on GCC runtime dll’s.</p>
<p>You will find those options on line 290 of Source/CMake/Modules/Urho3D-CMake-common.cmake and could try removing them, but the recommended course of action is to update to the latest MinGW-W64.</p>

I think i downloaded the latest, but still getting that error. I’ll investigate further. Thank you.</p>

<p>Something that isn’t clear is that mingw kind of forked a couple years ago.  The new stuff is the w64.</p>

<p>yup, that what I got, and still same error…<br/>
the gcc version is 4.9.1 make version 4.0.90<br/>
i tried the i686 version and the x86_64, i’ve tried serveral combinations… maybe i should just opt to find a visual studio download.</p>

<p>You can also try with the MinGW version shipped with Code::Blocks :<br/>

<p>I have just successfully built Urho3D library, its tools and samples on 64-bit Win7 build system. The build system itself is a guest virtual machine but I don’t see it would make any difference. Here is how I did it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall all existing MinGW installation. Making sure PATH environment variable does not point to any old MinGW version.</li>
<li>Install MinGW-W64 from <a href="http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/download.php">mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/download.php</a>. I chose Mingw-builds project instead of Win-builds project because I don’t intend to cross-compile on my virtual Win7 to other target platforms. I chose x86_64, POSIX, and SEH as installation option (default).</li>
<li>Open a DOS terminal, ensure the PATH environment variable is set to point to the newly installed MinGW-W64 binaries. For my case, it is: set PATH=C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-4.9.1-posix-seh-rt_v3-rev0\mingw64\bin;%PATH%</li>
<li>Execute cmake_mingw.bat with -DURHO3D_64BIT=1. I also enable LUAJIT and SAMPLES build options.</li>
<li>Then finally, make -j4. I use ‘make’ command that I got from msysgit (I think), but I believe the ‘mingw32-make’ provided by Mingw-builds project should also do the job well.</li>
</ol>
<p>I did not encounter the build issue you reported in the first post. Anyway, thanks for the incentive to get me upgrading my MinGW toolchain on my VM. <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/ab33f6c546ca85e7d84a4e3c32cd4034.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>

<p>I currently build Urho3D lib/samples/tools/docs with <span class="bbcode-b">dongsheng</span> daily mingw-w64 builds (<a href="http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net">mingw-w64.sourceforge.net</a> at the bottom). I’ve only yet tried the one targeting win32. Can extract the package, name it mingw, and add c:\mingw\bin to PATH.<br/>
Currently gcc-4.9.2 and make 4.0.</p>
<p>I also use Msys (bash/GNU in MS Windows is a godsend as well as GCC). In case anyone else has CMake complain about ‘sh.exe’ being in your path (even when it’s not): I finally hacked CMake/share/modules/CMakeMinGWFindMake.cmake to stop its complaining. I have msys\bin after other mingw in PATH.</p>

<p>I thank everyone for being so helpful.<br/>
But at the risk of dragging this on, i’m getting no where. Its not a big deal, I have urho built and working on my linux box, I was just trying to get something built on my windows workstation. Just, well to have it and as a learning process. And I’ve learned that I dont like windows anymore than I did yesterday.<br/>
First of all, I am no programmer, so i get lost fairly easily with tracking down what could cause the issues here. I followed your steps exactly weitjong, and same error. (just to add, I had to install cmake too) Maybe I need to start fresh.</p>
<p>It would be cool, to have a bat that made a codeblocks project. the sh file errors on my windows machine. Maybe that would keep some of the tail chasing to a minimum.</p>

<p>Hi ghidra,</p>
<p>Building on windows with Mingw32 or CodeBlocks is pretty simple. I guess it is the same steps with Linux. I have a Win7 64 system and I could test this again if you need more confirmation from other users…</p>

<p>well, i managed to get it to compile.<br/>
I ended up redownloading the source, then running cmake_mingw.bat with the -DURHO3D_64BIT=1.<br/>
Honestly I think that i forgot to do that the whole time, the 64 bit flag. Being as I am on Windows7 64 bit. All is well now. Thank you for your help everyone.</p>

If there had been a “wtf” with MSWindows, it would not have been the first time <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/ab33f6c546ca85e7d84a4e3c32cd4034.png" title=":slight_smile:"/><br/>
