<p>Suggestion: To create a sticky thread in showcase section, where people will post screenshots, gifs or videos of stuff they working on.</p>
<p>Better, than I ever can, this idea already described in this Blender Artists thread (whoa, it was in 2007): <a href="http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?87334-Screenshot-Extra-Extra!!" rel="nofollow noopener">blenderartists.org/forum/showthr … ra-Extra!!</a>!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basically - to go along with the other threads that were either dedicated to technical questions or to specific projects by particular people, they had this gigantic umbrella monster where people who didn’t feel like they were ready to make their own topic or those who only had a minor update that they’d made could just post a screenshot of something they were working on.</p>
<p>People would make comments on it and then post screenshots of their own.</p>
<p>Ultimately what you ended up with was a patchwork quilt that was made up of all of these different and varied projects that did a pretty reasonably good job of illustrating the state of activity of the entire community.</p>

<p>I’ve seen screenshots of great looking projects, people working on, occasionally popping here and there around the forum. Maybe thread like this will encourage people to share their work more often?</p>
