<p>Im trying to figure out how to make my items fit the attach bone more exactly, to avoid finding the correct offset and rotation, and I have a doubt about the difference between both settings in the exporter. Local means that the exported geometry has its own coordinates, starting at 0,0,0 or something like that?</p>

<p>You are using the reattiva’s exporter or AssetImporter tool ?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Local means that the exported geometry has its own coordinates<br/>
I guess local means that vertex positions will be represents as offset’s from origin (pivot - in 3dmax terms) of object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>global mean that in geometry data the vertexes position will be writing as offset from global vector3(0,0,0)</p>
<p>but I found that some times( actually most times:) ) we need local geometry but not local Node’s position settings.<br/>
for this issue i’m made cup of fixes for fork of reattiva’s exporter</p>
<p>link: <a href="https://github.com/MonkeyFirst/Urho3D-Blender">github.com/MonkeyFirst/Urho3D-Blender</a></p>
<p>but before start export need setup some specific settings:</p>
<p>[spoiler]Select object(s) that need to export<br/>
then choice Object -&gt;Apply -&gt; Rotation &amp; Scale ( not Location! this override vertex data in geometry as offset from global(0,0,0) )<br/>
then open settings set Front View = “Back” (only this work propertly, because i’m still not found the view’s right matrix to mulply, currently just do swap of axis )<br/>
origin = local<br/>
object = only selected<br/>
Export Urho prefabs = True</p>
<p><a data-bbcode="true" href="http://savepic.su/5360750.htm"><img alt="" height="" src="../../../images2/0c20cbfdd6a184eabd0fe33ced3b8fe1.png" width=""/></a></p>
<p>setup other setting as you needed<br/>
press export<br/>
you got an Data/Scenes/%Scene%.xml named as Scene.name in Blender<br/>
in this Scene you need find Node named as “Scene” you must save it as local node to Data/Objects/ as prefab.<br/>
Well, that’s all.<br/>
Use this prefab in you main scene, the nodes in it are must already placed as they placed in blender scene.[/spoiler]</p>

<p>Yes, I mean Blender exporter. I think you have cleared my doubts.</p>
