<p>D is a language that aims to be a successor to C++, and I know it’s much cleaner than it.  I haven’t used it myself though, as I haven’t had a project to work on with D.</p>
<p>I know that D is compatible with some but not all C++ libraries.  So is it compatible with Urho3D.  Is it possible for the entire game project to be written in D?</p>

<p>If anybidy cares at all.</p>
<p>If the interest is not pure academic, there were some discussions on web<br/>
aboiut interoperability of C++ and D and it is heavily compiler-dependent now.<br/>
gcc-7.x adopts D compiler, so there is some chance that if your code is built using gcc.<br/>
But I would not get high hopes. Also there is always Qt path - you can implement pure C binding<br/>
and use that from D (or anywhere like Python and other languages).</p>

<p>The interest is not pure academic.  I would actually want to write my game in D if I could.  But I don’t think I will as making the binding appears to be more complicated than just writing it in C++.</p>
<p>Isn’t the GDC compiler fairly new?  LLVM has a D compiler.  Is Urho3D compatible with LLVM?</p>
<p>It would be nice though if someone ported Urho3D to D.  Yes it would take some work, but compared to writing a new game engine?  If someone did, they should not bother with some features like Direct3D.</p>

<p>It might be possible to auto generate the majority of the bindings. (<a href="http://www.swig.org" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.swig.org</a>)</p>
<p>If you port Urho3D to D then you’ll be facing the same issue you’re facing now, only much larger: There are no D bindings for all of the thirdparty libraries used by Urho3D.</p>

<p>AFAIK, D is compatible with C++ in terms that you can use C++ classes, which are stored in linked library, so you can build Urho3D as .so/.a library and just link it with your D code, of course, you should somehow provide interface of Urho3D classes and methods in D, isn’t that right?</p>
