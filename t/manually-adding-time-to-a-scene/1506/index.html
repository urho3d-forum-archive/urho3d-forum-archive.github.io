<p>Is it possible to manually add time to a scene in relatively big deltas? (f.e. several seconds)<br/>
If so would it cause precision problems?<br/>
Or will have non-deterministic outcome compared to stepping the same amount over several frames (significant enough)?</p>
<p>Maybe by setting the engine’s min FPS to 0, and max FPS in such a way that it will step all the time in a single frame?<br/>
Maybe Engine::SetNextTimeStep() ?<br/>
Maybe step several normal frames until enough time has passed?</p>
<p>It also needs to affect only a single scene.</p>
<p>I’m mainly concerned about how it would affect model animation, particle effects and physics simulation.</p>

<p>Physics simulation is done on a fixed update, so this has no effect. Anything else done on a fixed update would not see an effect.</p>
<p>Consequently anything done on a standard Update would not be updated, as E_UPDATE would not be called (E_UPDATE actually triggers Scene::Update). So anything you want to be updated should either be done during a “fixed” update (E_PHYSICSPRESTEP) or a scene update (E_SCENEUPDATE).</p>
<p>Particle Emitter works off a Scene-based event so it should work fine.</p>
<p>Animated Model doesn’t use any Update events, it’s instead queried by the Octree (as a Drawable).</p>
