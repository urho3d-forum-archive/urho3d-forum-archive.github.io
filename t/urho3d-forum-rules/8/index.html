<h2>General Posting Guidelines</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>USE SEARCH FIRST!<br/>
There is a pretty good chance that unless you have some really odd or unique problem that it has been addressed on this forum before.<br/>
Use the forum’s search feature first to see if there are already some good threads on the subject. It’s easy to search – just click the “Search” button at the top right of the page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be DESCRIPTIVE and use common sense when naming your topic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post a descriptive topic name! Give a short summary of your problem IN THE SUBJECT. Don’t use attention getting subjects. They don’t get attention. They repel attention and annoy people.<br/>
Be patient, help people out by posting good descriptions of what you need help with, and not snapping at people if you don’t get a reply immediately, or did not get the reply you wanted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Misc</h2>
<ol>
<li>Signature<br/>
Signatures and avatar images are subject to the forum rules as well. Use common sense. Animating images should not be obnoxiously attention drawing or distracting (e.g. using a full-image black and white flashing) to not detract from following the discussion.<br/>
Maximum height of image: 64 px.</li>
