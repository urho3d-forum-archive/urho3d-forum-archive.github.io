<p>I think can get around that problem by defining some constexpr methods, I think (the hashing ones) and/or adding a user defined literal, but it might require c++14 for the while loop or a recursive style rewrite of the function.</p>
<p>But yes, if-else is probably easier.</p>

<p>If you really want that approach, without having to dig into the engine and modify things, then you could modify the <code>Source/Urho3D/Math/MathDefs.h</code> file and simply add near the <code>SDBMHash</code> function the following:</p>
<pre><code>/// Retrieve the lowercase version of an ASCII character.
inline constexpr int tolower_cx(int c) { return (c &gt; 64 &amp;&amp; c &lt; 91) ? (c + 32) : c; }

/// Retrieve the uppercase version of an ASCII character.
inline constexpr int toupper_cx(int c) { return (c &gt; 96 &amp;&amp; c &lt; 123) ? (c - 32) : c; }

/// Calculate the hash of the given ASCII string using the SDBM algorithm at compile time.
inline constexpr unsigned SDBMHash_Cx(const char* s, unsigned i, unsigned n, unsigned h) {
    return i &lt; n ? SDBMHash_Cx(s, i + 1, n, tolower_cx(s[i]) + (h &lt;&lt; 6) + (h &lt;&lt; 16) - h) : h;
}

/// User defined literal for converting strings to hashes at compile time.
inline constexpr unsigned operator "" _H(const char* str, size_t len) { return SDBMHash_Cx(str, 0, len, 0); }
</code></pre>
<p>Or even add it to your files if that’s all you need. Doesn’t matter where you add it as long as it can be used.</p>
<p>And then use the event name directly instead of it’s ID:</p>
<pre><code>switch (eventType.Value())
{
    case "KeyUp"_H:
    
    break;
    case "KeyDown"_H:
    
    break;
    default:
};
</code></pre>
<p>And if you want, you could change the user defined literal name from <code>_H</code> to <code>_E</code> or <code>_Event</code> if you want it to make sense. Or you could keep all of them since they’ll be discarded after compile.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of places where Urho could’ve make use of <code>constexpr</code>. But it’s using C++11 <code>constexpr</code>. Which is somewhat limited. Wish the engine would’ve jumped straight to C++14 since that’s the sweet spot between compiler support and language features. 17 would be too high but 11 is too low.</p>
<p>C++14 removes some <code>constexpr</code> limitations and would’ve made some things easier and probably better looking.</p>
<p>But at this point, the engine would require some major changes as it wasn’t initially designed with that in mind.</p>

<p>Why not just jump to C++14 now? Would the engine have to be refactored? I haven’t tried compiling it with C++14, but my own project needs it and compiles fine with Urho3D as library. EDIT: I suppose using a new C++ version would break the API, so perhaps it would be appropriate for Urho3D2.0.</p>
<p>Then just use 6-year lead time as policy for updating basic C++ version, or 4/5year idk.</p>

<p>The engine just recently “<em>switched</em>” to C++11. But only on paper. Not a lot of C++11 was adopted. And I honestly don’t mind. It would take a significant amount work to rewrite all parts of the engine to use C++11 or newer. So I don’t/can’t blame anyone for not happening. I’m certainly not helping in that regard. Even though I could. But time issues <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/94dd27e9c6c243335d29229e02e34e9d.png" title=":smiley:"/></p>
<p>So yes, you can enable C++14 if your project needs it. Engine has no issue regardless of what C++ version you use as long as it’s newer than what it needs.</p>
<p>MSVC likely played an important role in people adopting these new standards. Since it lags behind with implementing newer standards.</p>
<p>For example, the extended/relaxed <code>constexpr</code> from C++14 that I was talking about earlier was implemented in MSVC 2017 but IIRC it had issues which were addressed later on.</p>
<p>For comparison, GCC had it since version 5 from 2015 and Clang had it since version 3.4 from 2013.</p>
