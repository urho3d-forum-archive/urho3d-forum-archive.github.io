<p>I remember a few years back when I first saw urho 3d, nothing more than a toy project. It’s my great surprise to find out that the direction of the project changed towards a game engine, and on top of that it is quite feature rich, very nice, light weight API that feels like home, coming from Unity.</p>
<p>Big thanks to the devs for this great tool, I’ll be using this for at least a few projects to see how it fits my needs !</p>

<p>Welcome and thanks for your comments.</p>
<p>Urho3D becoming more serious and larger in scope is largely thanks to our growing number of contributors. I believe the aim was to be a game engine from the start, but it took some time before it could develop beyond the “toy” stage.  <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/c16ddadcbd525aa6d219a1df596d362f.png" title=":smiley:"/></p>

<p>After looking at the C++ demos, I am really impressed. Also, there is a robust editor to boot. I am totally going to make some games with it. The character demo was just the sort of example I was looking for.</p>
