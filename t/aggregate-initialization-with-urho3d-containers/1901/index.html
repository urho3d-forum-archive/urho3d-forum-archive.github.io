<p>Is there any way to do aggregate initialization with Urho3D containers?

<p>Does not look like it. However it is easy to add:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">#include &lt;initializer_list&gt;
#include &lt;utility&gt;

    /// Aggregate initialization constructor
    HashMap(std::initializer_list&lt;std::pair&lt;T, U&gt;&gt; list)
    {
        for (auto it = list.begin(); it != list.end(); it++)
        {
            Insert(Pair&lt;T, U&gt;(it-&gt;first, it-&gt;second));
        }
    }</code></pre>
<p>Note that this uses c++11 features therefore urho needs to be built with -DURHO3D_C++11=ON</p>
<p>EDIT:<br/>
Although i noticed we cant still do SendEvent(“Some event”, {{“key”, value}}); due to fact that SendEvent() does not take const VariantMap. This is very unfortunate. Sure we could add overload with const and cast constness away but IMO it would be better to just make VariantMap const. But it triggers ugly cascade of changes in source code. Bummer.</p>

<p>Well maybe it is not that big of a problem, since events are executed right on SendEvent() call. Until SendEvent() completes that const VariantMap is guaranteed to be alive anyway and there is little harm done in modifying that variant map in calls like SendEvent("…", {{“a”, 1}}). However it could be a problem if someone makes wrong assumption and passes his own instance of const VariantMap and it gets modified while user expects it to not be touched. So either risk that or give up “SendEvent(”…", {{“a”, 1}})" in favour of uglier “VariantMap args = {{“a”, 1}}; SendEvent(”…", args)". I personally hate writing two lines where one does suffice and is even more readable. Another solution would be boost way which looks like “VariantMap()(key, value)(key2, value2)” but i dont like it. It is a hack for pre-c++11 times. IMHO we should use built-in language stuff first if it is available. What do you think right way would be to go about this?</p>
<p>P.S. I already implemented these constructors for urho’s containers + SendEvent() with casting constness away. Ill make a PR when we figure out this const thing.</p>

<p>Yes that flag seems new. Aside from passing relevant compiler param (like -std=c++11) and adding preprocessor define its not used anywhere else. Although IMO we should take advantage of these new features. Would be especially handy if we could use lambdas in place of URHO3D_HANDLER(). Ill definitely add that for myself.</p>

<p>I think you guys meant compiler define. Yes, that “URHO3D_CXX11” is defined exactly for this kind of usage. The idea is to ease the transition to c++11 standard. Naturally since we could not (yet) set the c++11 standard as the default now, nothing should break when the new standard is not enabled. If you can ensure that then I think there is a good chance the patch such as this one will be accepted when you submit it as PR. However, having both const and non-const VariantMap version of SendEvent() may not be a good idea.  I recall we have already address the constant reallocation issue of event data map by reusing the map object. See the Context::GetEventDataMap().</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah I would prefer them too.<br/>
Also initializer lists are completely broken when used together with a variadic template, they really screwed that up. I tend to avoid initializer lists due to that completely.</p>
<p>Though variadic templates are more expensive compile time wise and force function definitions into headers which initializer lists do not (I think).</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t have the solution for that. Instead of creating another overload taking const VariantMap,  probably it is user own responsibility to do the const_cast when calling the existing one. And perhaps if we really want to create an overload to make SendEvent() usage simpler then we should make a variadic  template version of it, as already suggested by others. I believe we could implement a new one that internally call GetEventDataMap(), populate the map object with variadic arguments, and then call the existing SendEvent(). Thus, replacing the whole boilerplate code for sending event to just one line of code, similar to what you setup to do initially.</p>
<p>I think the aggregate initialization with Urho3D containers has its merit points in its own right.</p>

<p>I lean towards agreeing with you, but obviously thats not how Urho’s events are designed. They are more like a wrapper over a function calls rather than events, because SendEvent() directly invokes event handlers. In turn we suffer from various issues like lack of control during which stage event is invoked or inability to send events from other threads too.</p>

<p>Those cases are really a few. I can think of two events as it was contributed by me not long ago. See NavigationEvents.h and DatabaseEvents.h. These events are not supposed to be subscribed by multiple listeners. But of course there is nothing prevented that and should they actually send conflicting data input. You are welcome to change it if there is better way. Unless the signature has been changed, I treat the map object as the container to communicate data between event sender and event subscribers in both directions (although mostly only one direction).</p>
<p>Regarding sending events in worker threads, I believe that topic has been discussed here in the forums too. This is the latest discussion I could find quickly using google. <a href="http://discourse.urho3d.io/t/sending-event-from-non-main-thread/1687/1">topic1753.html</a>.</p>

<p>In a nutshell what you proposed is similar to what I have just done, except that my approach requires less punctuation marks. The variadic template is type safe. The compiler would ensure you cannot enter garbage parameter type in or that the parameter list is not correctly paired up. As for the bonus, I would even say mine has the advantage. A good C++11 compiler should resolve the recursiveness of the variadic template during compile time and inline the call, while your loop may or may not be unrolled to achieve the same result.</p>

<p>What i proposed is proper way of doing things. That template function is abuse of programming language. It is counter-intuitive as well as possibly generating bloat because thats what c++ templates do. Yes, it saves two characters, but at what expense?</p>

<p>I would just address your concern of the code bloat part. I believe it is actually unfounded. I have briefly explained in my previous comment why I believe that. I can even confirm that because I had already done the unit test before submitting the patch. In my test it showed that the generated assembly code from the variadic template (when fully optimized using -O3) had resolved all the recursive calls and all the functions were being inlined as if I had written all the boilerplate code by hand.</p>
