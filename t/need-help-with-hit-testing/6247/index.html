<p>I’m hoping someone can give me a few pointers for how to do hit testing in Urho3D.  I have a scene with several BillboardSets and a few other nodes.  I am trying to learn which billboard items are hit with either touch or the mouse.</p>
<p>One posting I read said you needed to raycast and said the Decals sample had an example.  I am not able to figure out how to use that to accomplish hit testing.</p>
<p>Any words of advice?</p>

<p>Yes raycasting is what should help you. Not sure where your problem lies with it. In short you will need a check like this when you get a mouse click (or whenever you want to check)</p>
<pre><code>        	unsigned int MASK = -1;//0xFFFFFFFF
        	Urho3D::Ray ray = camera-&gt;GetScreenRay(input-&gt;GetMousePosition().x_/float(window-&gt;GetSize().x_), input-&gt;GetMousePosition().y_/float(window-&gt;GetSize().y_));

        	PODVector&lt;RayQueryResult&gt; result;
        	RayOctreeQuery q(result, ray, RAY_AABB, M_INFINITY, DRAWABLE_GEOMETRY, MASK);
        	octree-&gt;RaycastSingle(q);

        	if(result.Size() &gt; 0){
            	Drawable* selectedObject = result[0].drawable_;
			//we hit something!
			}
</code></pre>
<p>whereas <em>window</em> is your Urho3D::Graphics* window and the Urho3D::Octree* <em>octree</em> needs to be initialized, perhaps together with your camera like this</p>
<pre><code>	octree = scene_-&gt;CreateComponent&lt;Urho3D::Octree&gt;();
</code></pre>
<p>The MASK property can be used to ignore certain objects but for most cases that is not necessary.</p>

<p>Thanks for the confirmation that this is the correct approach.  I have it mostly working now.</p>
<p>I need to detect taps on the billboard items.  It seems I need to use RAY_TRIANGLE rather than RAY_AABB for this to work.  If using RAY_AABB, I get a hit if I tap anywhere in the billboardSet’s volume and the SubObject is always null.  If I use RAY_TRIANGLE, I only get a hit when tapping on a billboard and SubObject will contain the index of the tapped billboard.</p>
<p>So I do have one additional problem.  The billboards in this case can be somewhat small (they represent deep sky objects in our Galaxy).  They are hard to tap when small.  I was hoping I could use the Aabb option and just increase the size of the bounding box.  That doesn’t seem like an option given what I said above.</p>
<p>I will either have to make the billboard larger and fill the periphery with transparent pixels, or I will need to do my own hot testing.  Any thoughts on how to write my own RaycastSingle that detects a hit on a slightly larger area than the triangles?</p>

<p>You could clamp the texture UVs by creating a <code>TextureName.xml</code> in the same folder containing:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;address coord="u" mode="clamp" /&gt;
&lt;address coord="v" mode="clamp" /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>…and modify the U/V offsets in the material’s XML.</p>
<p>I think that should work.</p>
