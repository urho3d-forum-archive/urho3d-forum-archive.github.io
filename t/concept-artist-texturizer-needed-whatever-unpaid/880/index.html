<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Is there anyone concept artist or graphics artist who can do texturizing and models? I am trying to put a team together. I am working on a game project. Open source and I need help building. It’s at the point of conceptual design and mechanics implementation. I have some of the model assets made already. My current pipeline of applications are Blender, Urho3D, Makehuman, <a href="http://SnappyTree.com" rel="nofollow noopener">SnappyTree.com</a> and a few other applications.</p>
<p>The initial goal is a exploration game for standalone immediately and online in the future. I am working on the client aspect. There is some Star Trek character models but majority of it is up to creative direction. I’m thinking on the scale of Eve Online/Mass Effect in a procedural environment. The overall concept is like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVl1Hmth3HE" rel="nofollow noopener">youtube.com/watch?v=ZVl1Hmth3HE</a> specifically ground map as first.</p>

<p>Okay. I posted a picture of terrain assets at <a href="http://imgur.com/a/6iNGh" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">imgur.com/a/6iNGh</a></p>
<p>The assets are named by planet type like desert, terrain, and ice then subtype like alien and terrain. So, I can have a alien blend file with assets per subtype planet type.  The file naming convention is the same or smiliar.</p>
<p>What i dont have is more variety in desert planet type for both terrain or alien, and variety of terrain plants and rock assets.</p>
<p>So, I one or two cactus and grass for terrain earth like and cactus like alien, then a few plants. That I can find some quick pictures.</p>
<p>I found some <a href="http://imgur.com/a/2gjLM" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">imgur.com/a/2gjLM</a></p>
<p>A few of the cactus plant can be alien or changed to be more alien like.</p>

<p>Which program do you use? If its Blender I can do a quick how to when I’m home.</p>

<p>Heres another quick dirty method I would do a cactus. I was rushing out the door.</p>
<p>If I had time I would make the circle 16 or 8 vertiices modeling at a low count and all quads.</p>

<p>Hope the link worked. The one you did practicing I we would use for a desert based plant cactus.</p>

<p>The one you made. I did a quick remesh with the uvmapped ane a plain default texture. If you want to see it and play with that.</p>
<p>In addition a plain texture terrain texture file.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/1aedfkxaawwzu28/TerrainDesertPlant-CactusSapien1.zip?dl=0" rel="nofollow noopener">dropbox.com/s/1aedfkxaawwzu … 1.zip?dl=0</a></p>
<p>If you want to play around with those, the terrain I used the pipes plugin that for the top part. A cube I subdivided to have the same number veritices along the middle as the pople. Then I bridge connected them and smoothed it.   Marked those linking areas then a simple uv unwarpped if finish.</p>
<p>You can probably play around with those you like then I can use those for the client. I just didn’t do grass which is straight forward. If you want to experiment use the hair emitter particle modifier system then convert it to a mesh with the Convert button.</p>
