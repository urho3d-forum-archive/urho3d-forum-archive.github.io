<p>Hello Everyone!<br/>
I want to procure a RayCast from my camera to anywhere else in the scene my mouse cursor goes.<br/>
To do this we need a cameraTarget or cameraLook. I cannpt find anything similar in the docs.</p>
<p>Can you help?<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<p>There is <code>Node::LookAt()</code>, although there may be a better way</p>

<p>Hey Micheal, check out the Decal sample. I’m pretty sure it raycasts from mouse cursor.<br/>
But if you have the mouse hidden at the center of the screen you have to do something like this (in lua, easily convertable):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">function Raycast(maxDistance)
	local pos=Vector2(graphics.width/2,graphics.height/2)
    local camera = cameraNode:GetComponent("Camera")
    local cameraRay = camera:GetScreenRay(pos.x / graphics.width, pos.y / graphics.height)
    local octree = scene_:GetComponent("Octree")
    local result = octree:Raycast(cameraRay, RAY_TRIANGLE, maxDistance, DRAWABLE_GEOMETRY)
	return result
end
</code></pre>
<p>Returns your result nodes, which can be multiple or one if you want.<br/>
Depending on what this raycast is used for, you might approach the issue differently.</p>

<p>It sounds like you’re looking for a way to implement basic mouse look. This would not require raycasting, instead converting cursor movement to the camera’s node rotation should suffice. But I may not be seeings things.</p>
<p>Also, welcome to the forums! <img alt=":confetti_ball:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/8cc1133d965c492d26cc2ba425a80ea1.png" title=":confetti_ball:"/> <img alt=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" src="../../../images2/083e71e9976093cddc504d689025b42c.png" title=":slightly_smiling_face:"/></p>

<p>Hi Gang!<br/>
I did look into the Decal sample and learned exactly what I wanted.<br/>
Speaking of decals,I was also looking into the possibility of having a 3d cursor as a Decal  whilst making the 2d cursor invisible…kindof like a decalled hand for instance touching the target Nodes in R3. I tried it with the example, and the urho fish decal just slips in trails from odd frames, but does lay its mesh decal. I know its a ‘frame’ engine too and not just a slobber fest. The Raycasting code btw, seems top notch quality easy to use - with the benefit of an enhanced resultQuery to query Node types so easily in the Update scenario…which is great for games.<br/>
For my purposes, I pulled about 20 things from the Demo’s to successfully port my 2project over to Urho, and I was up and running in 3 days work, with another few days for the scaffolding.<br/>
Also, the api is good enough!..many of the functions, such as the Quaternion function to represent not just a rotation - but a new axis set and an angle around that set - have enough documentation to track exactly what you need. I’m coming from a Irrlicht project where I used everything in the GPU.</p>
<p>My next conquest is LogicComponent to register your own StaticModel - like rendering Nodes for weapons and spells</p>
<p>Thanks for a great Engine!<br/>
btw my current project has about 64 characters and the performance is awesome indeed.<br/>
Kudos for you again!<br/>
